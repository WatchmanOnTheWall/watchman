INSERT INTO `chronicles` VALUES (1,'What is Your Vision?','<p>Vision is a critical issue for leaders and no leader of vany consequence can be without one. However, our idea of what constitutes vision may be lacking. People often ask me about my vision. Of course the answers typically expected are numeric in nature or involve a desired effect.</p>\n\n<p>Many expect that a vision must reach such and such a number or cause \'this or that\' effect. The question in and of itself is not a bad one, but often stems from misguided motivations. Why does our vision always include things we understand? Is it possible to long for what we have never seen and still call it vision? If so how do we answer the question?</p>\n<p>In the past these questions have caught me off-guard as most people anticipate a certain kind of answer, a kind that by its very nature limits vision. Like many others I have a vision, but what I am longing for cannot be measured by traditional means. Rather than being about the size of a church or a program for effecting change, it involves producing a certain kind of believer not yet seen in our generations.</p>\n<p>I am anticipating a kind of Christian that can only be defined as \'having the measure of the fullness of the stature of Christ\'. (Ephesians 4:13) I may not know how to get there, but it is obvious when we are not. Like the Dyson vacuum commercial guy, who hoped for a better kind of Vacuum, I know there is a quality of Christian beyond what we know - one that works! So when asked about my vision I find the range of responses typically expected woefully inadequate.</p>\n<p>The overwhelming sense I often get then when people ask the \'question\', is one of their impatience. It is like being on vacation with the kids when they ask that proverbial question: \'Are we there yet?\' The question is not in itself evil. However, it may be a reflection of \'immaturity\'.</p>\n<p>Immaturity is unable to wait for any length of time. Likewise, immature believers like neither waiting, nor any kind of uncertainty. As a result we are prone to substitute the result God intends, for one we think we can achieve.</p>'),(2,'The Entering','<p>Someone once told me that if the devil can?t keep you from being saved then he would work on making you ineffective.  This second tactic is obviously the strategy employed against Christians with an unacceptable degree of success. Far to many of us have languished in a spiritual ?no man?s land? \n\nwaiting for our day in heaven, largely because we have not understood the nature of the Kingdom of God. Too much of our effort and energy has focused on the visible and superficial elements of faith rather than the true essentials.  We are preoccupied with form, practiced behavior and the fear of wrong theology, all of which can be rectified by a greater manifestation of God.  Jesus identified two distinct levels of interaction with the Kingdom of God.  The first deals with seeing the kingdom while the second is about ?entering the kingdom?.  In the end, effective Kingdom Christianity is all about the entering. </p>\n<h4>Two-Dimensions</h4>\n<p>The world of sports offers us a great picture of these two dimensions of activity, watching and playing.  Personally I have had the luxury of participating in both.  My wife however is of the opinion that sports are one-dimensional and are meant for playing, not watching.  As a man, of course I am forced to disagree!  I think we men have a genetic disposition towards sports entertainment.</p>\n<p>Regardless the reality is that there are a lot more people watching sports than there are playing.  In fact there is a whole culture around the illusion of participation accompanying spectatorship. Fans represent themselves to have done something when their team wins.  There seems to be a shared joy in victory, and even sense of accomplishment afforded the sports devotee as though they had actually played in the game.  Furthermore, fans talk and act with the confidence of seasoned professionals.   What is that and why have we never questioned it?</p>\n<p>We sit comfortably on our sofas, surrounded by a generous assortment of snacks, occasionally hurling ?time-tested? wisdom towards the TV. This of course is with the benefit of the view from an aerial ?blimp? and four replays from at least three different angels.  You could say we are involved, but at a superficial level.  Yet, we act and speak as though knowing what it should look like is as good as actually doing it.  With fervent conviction we demand the firing of a coach and freely dole out our version of sound advice on radio call-in shows.  All the while relishing these ?pseudo coaching? moments as though they really mattered.  It makes me wonder how these polite radio hosts keep from laughing out loud.</p>\n<p>Now don?t misunderstand my intent in writing this.  The fact is we do not want to be overly harsh and in reality I have no real problem with the dynamics of spectatorship so long as they do not substitute for an actual life.  I watch my share of sports and have some opinions from time to time.  The enjoyment of sports and the athleticism of others is a great form of entertainment.  However, when this same dynamic is applied to our spiritual lives it can become a problem, and, in fact, it is a problem.  </p>\n<h4>Kingdom Spectators</h4>\n<p>In today?s Church world there is a reverence for the spectator, which is not in keeping with their contribution. Just like in the sports arena there is a participation present in two forms.  There are those who watch and lend their moral support, and then there are those who literally compete. And just like the sports world, in the church, there are a lot more people watching than there are playing.</p>\n<p>Jesus made reference to these two dimensions with cryptic language by distinguishing between two levels of Kingdom interaction.  It begins in His profound conversation with Nicodemus.  We should note that this is the same place where we get our fundamental understanding concerning being born again. </p>\n<p>Jesus points to the ?born again? experience as a must in order to see the Kingdom.  He said, ?Unless one is born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God? (John 3:3).  Being born again allows us to ?see? the Kingdom of God; our eyes our opened to a whole new world, which is in fact, a better reality.  What Jesus is speaking about is the bridge that will allow us to access this other world with all of its benefits and power.  This bridge is not the fullness of the Kingdom but a mere prologue or preamble.</p>\n<p>Nicodemus then begins an inquiry of his own, \'...How can a man be born when he is old? Can he enter his mother\'s womb again and be born?\' (John 3: 4), which Jesus seemingly ignores, as he simply continues to expound on the Kingdom.  In His next statement he adds the second dimension by saying ?Unless one is born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter the kingdom of God? (John 3:5).  While much discussion has surfaced over the meaning of being born of water and spirit,  the primary issue for us should be the dichotomy of experience.  That is, there is a ?seeing? of the Kingdom which is intended to be followed by the ?entering?.  Without both parts our experience is incomplete.  Maybe this is the reason much of the Church is lacking vision and motivation.</p>\n<p>At the same time we might even think we have experienced both sides when we have actually barely even tasted.  For example how many people are not serving God today because they went to Church and found nothing?  If you talk to them they will say that they ?tried? that.  But not all churches are the same and a large number are virtually void of the presence of God.  And so you have people thinking they know what God is offering when they really have never had the opportunity to taste the richness of His presence.</p>\n<p>Few have experienced this ?entering? dimension of the kingdom, but most would claim to know it.  Unfortunately we can often absorb the form of a truth and still never walk in the practical expression of the truth.  The idea of entering has been around for a long time.  Years ago when some new ground was being made around worship we talked about entering via worship.  We sang ?we will enter His gates with thanksgiving and His courts with praise? (Psalm 100:4).  It was around this theme that I personally made the connection around the concept of ?entering?.  I realized that worship was a literal advancement into God?s presence.  While this truth and the songs marked out with greater clarity the principle, the literal result was that we still had times where we sang the songs without actually entering.  Singing the words ?we enter? does not automatically translate into ?entering?.  And so once again many become inoculated against the deeper significance of a truth believing to have tasted but in reality they have only observed from a distance.</p>\n<p>The carnal mind is glued to this present dimension and is more likely to think of ?entering? as a mere metaphor rather than an actual part of our experience.  The lack of impact furthers the notion that we are not meant to experience anything and so we develop a belief that we now have to move onto some other emphasis to placate our need for meaning, when what we really want is right there in front of us.  Like a rich treasure we have to persevere and dig a little deeper.</p>\n<p>God is looking for a people to move beyond the theoretical.  The Spirit of God is making a distinction between those who enter and those who just sing the songs.  Recently a visitor to our church shared their experience in these words, ?I like the place you go to?.  I?m not sure whether their use of those words was purposeful or accidental but it reflected a reality.  We must learn to transcend the natural realm.  John wrote ?I was in the Spirit on the Lord?s day.?  (Rev 1:10)  Far too many gloss over this kind of language and suppose it to be some kind of contemplative posture.  It was not!  To those who have pressed through there is a deliberate and purposeful ascension.  John knew how to enter the Kingdom and thereby walked in a dimension that empowered him to experience what he called the ?Revelation of Jesus Christ?. (Rev 1:1)  It is the honor, grace and privilege of every other believer to do the same.</p>'),(3,'Experiencing God','<p>The other day a young man told me about being healed from color blindness.  For years he had this condition but did not know it.  People would talk about the splendor of fall with all its radiant colors and he could not make sense of it.  Sure it was all ?nice? and everything, but it seemed as though the hype was a little exaggerated in his mind.</p>\n\n<p>That is, of course, until his eyesight was healed.  Suddenly the fullness of what was always there came into view.  That is when he realized that while he had been looking at the same trees and fields as others, he was seeing a limited version of it.  What if we were all experiencing only a fraction of what was there?  What if, while we are convinced we are ?tasting and seeing? God, we are all functioning from a diminished capacity?  Considering the infinite expanse of an unfathomable God there is no question this is true!  The only real question now is ?How much are we missing??\n  <img class=\'image\' style=\'width: 250px; float: right;\' src=\'images/newsletter/experiencinggodtitle.jpg\' alt=\'experiencinggodtitle\' /></p>\n<h4>Taste and See</h4>\n<p>We are told in the scripture to ?taste and see that the Lord is good? (Psalm 34:8).  This suggests some kind of experience as a natural part of our faith.  Worship in particular should be a place and time where we experience God.  There is clearly divine strategy behind worship, but consider something for a second.  Have you ever looked at someone worshipping God and thought they were getting more out of this than you were? As they abandoned themselves and cried out, demonstrating sheer exhilaration, did you wonder what you were missing?  If so you are not alone.</p>\n<p>The truth is we are disposed to justifying ourselves.  That is, the underlying impulse is to believe that there is nothing wrong with ?me or my experience with God?.  This is especially true if you have been at this a long time. When it looks like you are missing something you might first make some attempt to grab it.  If your attempts are not met with success in a timely manner you probably will begin to look for other answers.</p>\n<p>Those answers are in all likelihood an attempt to dismiss what others have as being unnecessary or invalid. We might for example rationalize that others are simply more disposed to ?that kind of thing?. Or we avoid the issue by creating an explanation that improves our position.  For example, ?my faith is rooted in a genuine reality rather than subjective emotion?; ergo, I have no need of ?experienced based frivolity?.  Entire systems of thought are created to evade any possibility that someone else might have more of God than we do.  Or worse yet, that we have on some level refused to develop an appetite for God.</p>\n\n<p>Hunger for God is something that can increase and decrease.  Jesus warned us of a quenching of the seed of God?s Word by the cares and concerns of this world.  John told us not to love the world (1 John 2:15).  The truth is our desire for more of God can be disappointed, offended or overcome.  In short, it can be stolen from us!</p>\n<p>In the same way that a man can lose his taste for food we can lose our taste for God.  Consider a smoker.  Anyone who has been a smoker for a long period time can attest to a loss of a sense of taste.  Their taste buds die or lose the ability to enjoy the tang and zest of good food.  There is nothing wrong with what they are eating.  The food contains all of the same stimulus and spectrum of flavor, but their mouths are no longer alive to the experience.</p>\n<p>When your ability to taste is lost you are functioning from a diminished capacity.  Everything necessary for the full measure of experience is there within the food but the defect is found elsewhere!  While others rave about the meal, citing some distinct edges and subtle beauty in the spices, to you, it is all oatmeal minus the sugar.  Everything is bland and flat, so much so that you find it hard to even sit down for a meal.  When this is how you feel about God do not despair.  Sometimes these seasons are part of a pruning process to test our hearts.  The struggle of this season will always come when we choose to believe that something else ie. the food is at fault.  It is a time to faithfully declare ?God is good and His mercies endure forever?.</p>\n<h4>A Limited Appetite</h4>\n<p>Sometimes the issue is not a complete loss of hunger but a limited appetite.  I, personally, have a notoriously low capacity for large meals.  When we go to a buffet I never feel like I get my money?s worth.  As I watch others heaping easily twice as much on their plate in one sitting as I can consume in an entire meal, I wish I could eat more.  At a buffet there are so many choices to entertain the palate.  Usually I try to take a tiny amount of just some of the good stuff hoping to come back for seconds.  It rarely works, as my appetite is quickly satiated.  When I was younger I would eat more anyway for the sheer enjoyment but would then be in pain for hours after.</p>\n<p>This illustration speaks again of a kind of diminished capacity.  While one might be able to enjoy the food equally as another, in terms of savoring the flavors, the experience goes on much longer for one than the other.  If we were to quantify the experience and give value to the amounts of enjoyment, clearly one person can ?enjoy? more than the other.  At the end we might be equally satisfied but one has taken in much more.</p>\n<p>The two dimensions together then a person could potentially enjoy a meal multiplied times above another.  There is a depth of taste that enhances the intensity of the food experience, as well as the literal amount one can eat.  We could say it amounts to both depth and breadth.  Two people taste the same pizza but one cannot take in the flavors or eat as much.  Now apply this to taking in the beauty and goodness of God.</p>\n<h4>Opening the Senses</h4>\n<p>The Apostle Paul considered this a central issue and so much so that he frequently prayed that God would open their ability to perceive.</p>\n<p><strong><em>?That the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give unto you the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of him:  The eyes of your understanding being enlightened; that you may know what is the hope of his calling, and what the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the saints, and what is the exceeding greatness of his power toward us who believe, according to the working of his might power.?</em></strong> (Ephesians 1:17-19)</p>\n<p>Contrary to our typical thinking, wisdom and understanding are not fixed abilities.  We can actually increase our ability to absorb more of God.  In fact, the very nature of our growth and development requires this increase.  Faith and passion for God enable us to receive more of him, which is to say, become filled with the knowledge of who He is.  Later in Ephesians Paul expands on this prayer saying:</p>\n<p><strong><em>?For this cause I bow my knees unto the Father ? that he would grant you, ?, to be strengthened with might by his Spirit in the inner man? that you, being rooted and grounded in love, may be able to comprehend with all saints what is <span style=\'text-decoration: underline;\'>the breadth, and length, and depth, and height; and to know the love of Christ, which passes knowledge, that ye might be filled with all the fullness of God</span>.?</em></strong> (Ephesians 3:14-19)</p>\n<p>It is not an accident that Paul mentions the breath, length, depth and height of the love of God.  He is purposely demonstrating the many dimensions of the love because they are missed.  Who knows how much we are missing?  Perhaps the most any typical believer gets is a two-dimensional revelation.  What a tragedy!</p>\n<p>What if we could grow in our ability to increase our senses? As it is the best of us are still looking through a glass darkly (1 Cor. 13:12).  We are all beginning from a deeply flawed perspective.  We can rejoice in each increase but we should never be satisfied.  Like the man who was color blind, we cannot know what we are missing until we are healed.  What if we could heighten the flavor of God?s presence; hear precisely the whispers of His voice; touch the manifestation of His Glory; smell the fragrance of the Lord and see that the Lord really is good?  There are additional veils from which we can be released.  This in fact is what is in the heart of God.  He means to increasingly satisfy us by refining our capacity to taste, touch, smell, hear and see.  His desire is to make us like the host of heaven, who not only appreciate the full spectrum of His beauty, but they never tire of beholding Him.</p>'),(4,'The Authentic Sound','<p>What is God waiting for?  What does He want?  What is He looking for?  Why does He not bring revival now?  Why does everything take so long?</p>\n<p>These are some of the questions Christians are asking in these days.  They are not new questions as they have plagued the minds of believer and unbelievers alike for centuries.  Yet, the answer remains the same now as it was then:  Worship!  God is looking for worship and a very specific kind.</p>\n\n<p>The kind of worship God is looking for is foreign to us as fallen natural beings whose affinity lies with the earthly temporal realm.  This present dimension veils for us the deeper sense of what He needs.  So while we are sincere, our sincerity is misguided and over valued.  Sincerity is limited by knowledge. </p>\n<p>The knowledge of our own hearts is the primary limitation.  Like the Hebrews of the Old Testament and of Christ? own day He says the same about us. ?These people draw near to Me with their mouth and honor Me with their lips, but their heart is far from Me. (Matthew 15:8) The fact is we have divided hearts and so when we purpose to ?cry out? to God, the cry rings shallow and empty in His ears.  Why?  Is it because we are insincere?  No, but because we lack the ability to marshal the scattered resources of our heart and hurl them in the direction of God.</p>\n<p>When I was a young boy I remember watching a number of movies that left me with a thrill and wonder.  Years later I found the occasion to watch some of them again.  I was shocked by my own ignorance.  For what had left me in awe as a five year old seemed now to be cheap and empty.  What I had retained through the years was the memory of the adventure, but my young mind was ill equipped to verify the authenticity of the plot and most importantly the quality of the acting. </p>\n<p> What I had remembered of the dialogue and action had mesmerized me but now I was looking at a clearly ?B? Movie (a generous assessment).  Similarly as I reflect on my own history of worship I see cheesy attempts to abandon myself to God.  But you cannot honor God with a divided heart.  When in the secret places of your heart you covet honor, you cannot give that part away.  This was why Jesus was so harsh toward the Pharisees.  He knew they loved the ?praises of men?.  When our hearts want to be lifted up it cannot lift Him up.  If the heart desires even some honor for itself it reserves that portion by holding apart.  This is the essence of a divided heart.  The result is empty words and phrases, correct in doctrine but only honest in terms of the level of honesty we understand at the time.  Yet, we cannot stop from doing even that part that we are able to do.  A ?B? movie is better than no movie at all.  It only becomes a problem when we choose to ignore God?s rating system. </p>\n<p> And so the Church is on a journey toward a pure sound of desire that draws the heart of God.  It cannot be accessed artificially!  You cannot pretend to mimic real desire.  The truth of who you are will always shine through.  The difference can be illustrated partly by looking at great actors.  Great actors have the capacity to abandon themselves to a role.  In their minds they can literally become the person they are portraying.  The difference is most evident when one sees bad acting.  A bad actor is like someone who knows what to say but withholds the larger part of themselves.  This literally defines the generations of the Church.  </p>\n<p>Goaded by guilt and shame we force ourselves to do what is right out of fear but we lack the ability to fully abandon ourselves to Him.  Our lives become a diary of compartmentalization as we divide what really want from we know we ought to want.  This division becomes the very thing that makes our sound empty and unappealing.  What is God looking for?  He is looking for fullness of heart.  ?For the eyes of the Lord run to and fro throughout the whole earth, to show himself strong in the behalf of them whose heart is perfect toward him.? (2 Chronicles 16:9)  The word perfect means complete and encompasses the idea of nothing missing and nothing in reserve. </p>\n<p> As such I have begun to see that throughout the earth God is fashioning a cry of unfathomable depth.  Every Church and every service is like a rehearsal for an upcoming theatrical event where God will cross the threshold of space and time to invade the earth.  Yet, it is not a one-time event.  The fullness of our expression dictates the fullness of His response.  Every exposure of our heart adds a deeper layer of desire.  Increment by increment the quality of our worship becomes more believable to His ears.  This is not because we are better at masking the truth, but because our worship has simply grown more real.  And so with each increase in desperation there is a corresponding answer.  What does God want?  He wants to be genuinely wanted.  To the degree that this is so, He apportions His presence to bless, heal and deliver. </p>\n<p>Remember!  The pure in heart shall see God.</p>'),(5,'Jacob Have I Loved','<p /><span style=\'font-family: Verdana;\' />We have asked for the glory and the glory is coming.  However it  may not be what we expect it to be.  He who dwells in unapproachable light is fearsome to those who are unprepared.  While we revel \n\nin the idea of the ?shaking of all things? we must be reminded the Israel?s response was the human one ? fear and withdrawal.  Yet, the sound of inevitability draws near.  He is coming with pronounced determination!\n<p>Recently we have begun to see flashes of that glory.  This past August a wind of the Spirit blew through Spruce Grove Community Church while I was preaching on the theme ?Jacob have loved?.  This theme addresses the issues of God?s choices.  He has a particular value system that is not often shared by us.  This is evident in our criticism of leaders and those He anoints. ?Why is it we are so often offend by the ones He raises up??  It is because we esteem ourselves more worthy of His blessings and authority than those whom He chooses.  We elevate ourselves by judging the Just Judge.  Yet, He declares again ? ?Jacob have I loved?!</p>\n<p>During these moments the fear of the Lord entered the room and people randomly began to stand and cry of to the Lord? during the  preaching.  It became apparent that a sword was being unsheathed.  There is an administration of Christ about to unfold that defies imagination.  It goes far beyond the dimension of talented and articulate speech into the realm of the manifestation of Christ.  Another taste of this dimension surfaced again during our mid-week prayer this past week.  Several people testified to experiencing a dimension of the fear of the Lord and the power <br />of His penetrating gaze that defies description.  There is a rising tide of light entering the Church and the realm of the earth that we must not only welcome, but love.  Get ready for the ride of your lives.</p>'),(6,'God\'s Army','<p /><span style=\'font-family: Verdana;\' />We used to sing a song and likely somewhere someone is still singing it. It says, ?God?s got an army marching through the land, deliverance is their song and healings in their hand?. It is a great rousing tune that celebrates the victorious company of people that God is releasing and using in the earth today. It taps into prophetic themes as within the heart of so many lingers a promise of a great host of volunteers who will walk in the fullness of a promise. But who is in this army? And what qualifies us to walk in the ranks of such a people?  </p>\n<p>I was struck with this and other questions recently while on a trip through the United States. I spent a couple of days at a conference attended by almost 5000 people.  The crowd was largely boisterous and clearly hungry for the Word of God. There were tremendous moments of praise and a deep stirring of faith. Prophetic words about coming blessings were met with loud cheers and hearty agreement. When speakers referred to defeating Satan or walking as an ?overcomer?, there was rejoicing on levels you only see outside of conservative Canada. All in all it was on one level delightful; yet my heart was heavy because I knew that 90 percent of these people were not going to see much of that victory.</p>\n<p>These people were sincere, caring and likely wonderful Christians. Unfortunately our readiness for battle does not ride solely on these characteristics. God does have an army for whom defeat will not be an option. But the enthusiastic embrace of the promise is not a guarantee of membership. Mere agreement with the fact that God is going to win is not the key criteria. The reality we face is rather that many are called but few are chosen. Greeting the promise with enthusiasm in an important start but that?s all it is ? A Start!</p>\n<p>The guarantee of your status is not in your hopes and dreams, it is found in the reality that follows your enlistment. When we watch a recruitment video for the Marines it all looks like a lot of adventure and excitement, but when boot camp rolls around it is an entirely different story. Adventure and challenge are in the future but are predicated upon many other factors. Once the stark reality of training hits, you might feel like you were tricked. This is because there is a huge difference between what you felt when you heard the promise and what you feel in the middle of training.</p>\n<p>The promise, as delivered from an anointed vessel, excites and strengthens. But the journey will feel quite different. This is where some begin to opt out of the training. The romantic ideas of battle and victory lead into commitment but when the reality does not match our expectation we go AWOL (Absent Without Leave). In the real military you go to jail if you do not follow through with your commitment. In the Kingdom of God you are set on the shelf. Not a punishment but as a consequence. Simply put, the coach cannot have you run a ten-mile race if you can?t run one mile. </p>\n<p>Today this is the situation in many Christian circles. Many have responded to the promise. They have seen the commercials and have eagerly signed up. However, the training did not feel the same as the promise and so they have abandoned the journey. Metaphorically speaking they keep going back to watch the commercial to recapture that good feeling. Going from church to church and conference to conference they live off the initial release of faith that comes from another anointing underscoring the promise. Yet, month passes to month and year to year without meaningful growth or change.</p>\n<p>There is a journey that trains our character and deepens our faith and love for God and His people. It is difficult but empowering. God is looking for an army and you can be part of it. The journey is the key component in our preparation. There is no alternative substitute for it! There is no anointing that can replace it. And celebrating those ministries that reiterate the promise will not replace the work that must be done at a root level in our lives. Finally, you cannot buy a place in the army. Tithing is critical and supporting good ministries is essential but neither of these things can take of the place of learning to walk with God?s people. There is an army that is rising in the earth, but like Paul and his disciple Timothy, they learned to endure hardship as good soldiers.</p>\n<p>?You therefore must endure hardship as a good soldier of Jesus Christ.? (2 Timothy 2:3)</span></p>'),(7,'Righteous Foundations','<p>As the world enters lawless times the calling of the Church will become increasingly distinct and vital.  At the same time God will use these periods to distinguish between those expressions of Christianity who perform the will of their Master and those that have become superfluous and meaningless.  Not meaningless in the sense that they provide no perceived benefit to their surrounding community, but meaningless in that they have ceased to function as an agency of the Kingdom of God.  When the salt has lost its savour what good is it?  According to Jesus it is destined for the garbage heap.</p>\n\n<p>There is coming a divine favour and influence for those Churches who rise to their true calling.  Those Churches that have elected to remain spiritually significant are now being encoded with an ability to sustain and protect entire communities and regions.  They will become in effect the true salt and light, not in theory or theology, but in reality.</p>\n<h4>Righteous Foundations</h4>\n<p>For decades the western hemisphere has enjoyed the overflow of righteous foundations.  These foundations have provided for a period of relative tranquility.  Despite objections to the contrary, we have lived in a comparatively law abiding society.  However the effect of righteousness recedes when it is not infused and renewed with the life found in fresh revelation.  Old foundations, no matter how well constructed, will eventually decay.  With it will come the emergence of a fresh face of evil that will astound an unassuming public.  This is inevitable unless there is a relevant and effective expression of God in the local community.  In these times the maturity and disposition of the Church will be tested and tried.  If we really are the salt and light we are meant to be, the day will declare it.</p>\n<p>The role of the Church as salt and light is not largely understood in these days.  It is perhaps better expressed in this Old Testament passage:</p>\n<p>?Those from among you shall build the old waste places: you shall raise up the foundations of many generations; and you shall be called, The repairer of the Breach, The restorer of streets to dwell in?Isaiah 58:11-13.?</p>\n<p>We, the Church, are called to do the following things:</p>\n<p> To build the old waste places, raise the old foundations, repair the breaches and restore streets to dwell in.  Like many of you reading this I grew up in communities where these things were somewhat present.  Our streets were safe and breaches in societal norms were uncommon.  That is, we lived in places where we were unafraid to let our children play outside and we could take a family stroll without concern for our wellbeing.  The streets are suitable and in some ways an extension of our homes; suitable to dwell in.</p>\n<p>This atmosphere of safety exists when there is an adequate sense of common morality and widespread appreciation for each others pursuit of justice.  The net effect is a peaceful society where men and women prosper socially and economically.  When you are raised in such an atmosphere it is easy to forget how this came about.  In fact you might begin to believe that it was always there ­­- a product perhaps of a superior people.</p>\n<p>This is exactly the kind of presumption we must avoid but it has been present and is increasing.  Over time we have come to believe this atmosphere of serenity to be the norm and furthermore that we and it are the same.  When we see news stories of genocide from across the globe we make ourselves believe it is because they are barbarians and we are not.  We err by imagining our relative calm to be the natural outworking of our pleasant dispositions and the default position of common sense and reasonable upbringing.  Such reasoning is profoundly faulty.  The truth is we inherited a spiritual blessing we did not work to obtain. </p>\n<p>We were born in a time when attitudes of civility and a commitment toward the common good were widely embraced.  Because we have known little else we assumed these traits are native to who we were as human beings.  But they are not!  Man?s default position is to place himself above everyone else no matter what the cost to others.  Three-quarters of the world?s population understand this fact and have grown up under the warlords and totalitarian dictators who daily impress this reality upon them. They have witnessed the devastating power of man?s relentless selfish pursuits.  The supposed norm of widespread public courtesy is acquired at great cost by visionary spiritual leaders.</p>\n<h4>Where does it begin?</h4>\n<p>What the Western Hemisphere has forgotten is that the blessing of a stable society and prosperity was made possible by invisible commodities foreign to man.  Righteous foundations were developed over generations by a people who were committed to memorizing, studying and living the Word of God.  It is not our stable political system that is responsible for our wellbeing, but our wellbeing that is responsible for our stable political system - where our wellbeing goes so does our political system.  Add to that our social and economics networks.  And in case you have not noticed, every single one of these has taken some major hits in the past few years.</p>\n<p>The question we should be asking is where did the wellbeing come from?  Since we talk so much about dysfunctional families these days we should perhaps wonder when we abandoned the functional ones.  What is the reason men cannot stay loyal to their wives and vice versa?  Have the sexes become so radically different in the last 70 years.  I think not, but our wellbeing is evaporating as is our ability to withstand emotional strain, insult or even the mildest of rejection.  It used to be men could disagree without a great deal of consequence.  Now, fragile ego?s backed by knives and guns blaze into aggression without the slightest provocation.  It is weakness making a show of strength. </p>\n<p>The volatility we see in the streets a direct of a diminishing foundation of self-worth, which incidentally does not come from rehearsing mantra?s designed to elevate oneself.  A loser is not made a winner by the sound of his own voice.  Such miracles emerge only when one has heard the sound of an eternal voice.</p>\n<p>Surely it should be becoming clear that previous generations possessed a moral strength of character that is diminishing.  It is not that those generations were without problems and weaknesses.  But where does the strength come from to endure years of war and the great depression?  You would think these circumstances might put pressure on families and that people would be tempted to cut and run.  Some did but the majority had the strength to stick it out.  Where does it come from?  Where can a generation get that kind of ability once again?</p>\n<p>The fact is this kind of stability and emotional strength can only from God.  Previous generations have lived their lives seeking more of Him and this has been the outcome - millions of people acknowledging the truth down through the years, while doing their best to embrace, among other things, the Golden Rule of Scripture.  They built their lives around the solid rock of truth and, by extension, they became strong themselves.  Furthermore, the truth was so collectively embraced that it made its way into the fabric of community.  This is where and how righteous foundations are established.</p>\n<p>Once a nation has righteous foundations it causes a passive awareness of what is ?just and right? to fill the very air.  People are then disposed and to a degree compelled to consider their fellow man.  There is a prevailing atmosphere over the sin impulse in man that restrains his selfish ambition.  When this atmosphere evaporates so does the stability it created.  The diminishing of this restraint is both a warning and an inevitable fruit of self-righteousness.</p>\n<h4>Modern Erosion</h4>\n<p>In the days that approach a clear demarcation will surface between Life and Death.  Today, we live in the wake of the righteousness of our forefathers, but the effect of their prayer and devotion will not endure forever.  Western society, with its stability and prosperity, exists because of ?inertia of righteousness? largely left over from previous generations.  Those cities and regions that do not renew the foundations or mend the breaches will see that ?streets to dwell in? are indeed illusive and rare.</p>\n<p>When a society ceases to recognize the ?source of good?, the effect of the good begins to recede.  This is not evil but a work of the mercy of God.  It is His goodness that we are not indefinitely left to the whims of our delusions.  He protects His glory and gives us wisdom by revealing that He alone is the source of Life and that everything not sustained by that Life decays.  And so by allowing righteous foundations to erode He clarifies what is born of man and what is born of God.  He demonstrates the foolishness of abandoning faith and the knowledge of God.  The pattern of this kind of erosion is cited in Romans 1:28 when Paul wrote ?And even as they did not like to retain God in their knowledge, God gave them over to a debased mind, to do those things which are not fitting.? </p>\n<p>To best understand the meaning of this passage we have to look outside of our society.  Recently during a trip to Europe I witnessed a foretaste of this kind of erosion.  It came while we were in Brussels Belgium travelling with a wonderful African pastor from Holland.  We were gridlocked in traffic for many hours when in frustration he made a bold statement.  ?This place is becoming too much like Africa, I hate it!?  The reason for his outbreak was the mayhem we witnessed on the street.  This city was not like one would expect in Europe but had begun to look like what he remembered from his youth.  Instead of order and a general acknowledgement of typical traffic laws, it was a quagmire of confusion.  It was ?traffic anarchy? where every man did what was right in his owns eyes.</p>\n<p>All of the classic rules of the road were almost entirely ignored.  There was no sense of right of way, lanes or respect for order of any kind.  Rather, the most aggressive went first.  On one occasion as we travelled down a one lane street, an oncoming driver stopped, turned off his car and entered a local establishment.  He did not park or give any thought to the 8 to 10 vehicles behind him that suddenly had no way of getting by.  This kind of inconsiderate act is practically beyond comprehension.  Yet, somehow he was blind to any convention or propriety that would have him consider any need but his own. He either could care less about the convenience of other drivers or had become entirely blind to the world outside his own. </p>\n<p>Such is the reality of lawlessness when righteous foundations disappear.  It is then that we begin to realize that respect for the common good is not a natural default position of the human heart.  Presumption in the western world has led us to believe that we are morally superior.  Westerners, who benefit from an invisible spiritual heritage, assume attitudes responsible for order in society are inherent to our nature.  This is a pride God intends to take down.  The fact is we are on the precipice of a moral meltdown and this is our future if we cannot rebuild the ancient ruins.  These scenarios are literally a microcosm of what comes to a nation void of righteous foundations.  Bold brute force becomes the order of the day.</p>\n<p>As it stands many who read this might already be saying it is already present.  They are right!  In certain neighbourhoods and districts in our modern North American cities the rule of law is giving way to a different kind of order built on fear, intimidation and raw brutality.  There is no respect for fair play or rational thought because the people who aim to govern have no righteous foundations in their lives.  This is the reason that Western Democracy cannot effectively prosper in certain parts of the earth.  Western democracy can only prevail where foundations exist.  A threshold of respect for the common good cannot be created by government, however when it is present, healthy democracy can survive.</p>\n<h4>The Call</h4>\n<p>Many of us have failed to realize the long-term effect that a Judeo Christian Heritage has on a people.  There is a mystical invisible hand working in nations whose God is truly the Lord.  It withholds the true nature of man by ruling over his base desires.  The days ahead will testify to this fact.  On the other hand, where Apostolic Centers of influence arise we will see the effect of righteousness on the people and the construct of society.  We are entering a time when the government of God will prevail in regions where the Church is actually being salt and light.  God will make a distinction between what is actually born of Him and what resembles something He made.  The first endures while the later comes to nothing.</p>\n<p>It is to the glory of God that the strength of men fails.  The ends times are not about evil flourishing in the earth.  Rather, the Lord God intends to make a distinction between good and evil.  He will erase the confusion that currently exists between who is really responsible for the good that we see.  He is jealous to obtain the glory and the honour.  And so there is coming a shifting of influence toward righteousness.  As the heavens look on, they will be utterly astounded by the wisdom of God.  Where righteous foundations are being actively built and maintained we will see the blessing, but where man is left to his own devices, confusion and disorder will follow.  ?Those from among you shall build the old waste places: you shall raise up the foundations of many generations; and you shall be called, The repairer of the Breach, The restorer of streets to dwell in?Isaiah 58:11-13.?</p>'),(8,'Why Repent','<p>Those who the Lord will use are those prepared to listen and obey. Function in this kingdom hinges not on past history but present willingness. If we look back or consider our own names, we will become static and unable to move. We must be willing to become like little children who have little history and no reputation. In these the Lord will find the servants whose zeal and faith know no bounds.</p>\n\n<p>Resistance to repentance has been on the rise in recent months.  It is as though questions were being raised such as: ?Are we repenting again?? When will enough be enough??  Why don?t we move on?? We already did this!?  Some of these questions are rooted in immaturity and presumption, while some are motivated by a simple desire to understand.  However, in some cases there is an issue of pride and false faith.  Whatever the reason, it seems clear that many have reached or are approaching their threshold of tolerance.  And so, to go further, we must answer the question, ?Why should we repent?\'</p>\n<h4>Who we are!</h4>\n<p>To fully answer the question we must come to an understanding that when we repent we are not just repenting for actions, but for the disposition that makes those acts possible.  For example, a man can ask forgiveness for his own sin.  This kind of repentance is not hard to understand.  On the other hand, a man can also walk in perpetual repentance, knowing we share a common weakness with all mankind.  The first is grieving over one?s sin, and the other is a grieving over one?s sinfulness. When we know what we are each capable of, it makes it easier to carry a contrite spirit willing and able to repent at short notice. </p>\n<p>But there is something in us that dislikes failure of any kind.  To be identified with poor performance is not something we pursue.  Our natural inclination is to associate with victory rather than failure.  Very few people would run up to the loser of a race and ask to be photographed with him.  Poor performance, and the memory of it, is something we prefer to sweep under the rug and forget.  When we are image conscious we distance ourselves from things that cast a bad shadow on us.  If we ever become comfortable with weakness, it is usually only after we are well beyond it.  For this reason the idea of perpetual repentance is not pleasantly received by our flesh.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately for fragile egos, it is what we are called to do.  One of the chief reasons we do live in continuous repentance is, at least in part, because we are attempting to hide from who we really are.  We must not forget that who we are as a result of the grace of God cannot nullify who we are without Him.  Understanding this is fundamental to our function as ambassadors of Christ.  We are meant to be instruments of reconciliation to the world.  But how can we reconcile when we mistakenly believe ourselves to be above the sin which plagues mankind.  The Lord did not redeem us so we could feel superior.<br />Isaiah 58 is a powerful call to true service to God that exposes the self-righteous inclination of man.  The call highlights the fact that we are not called to secure our own standing and wellbeing, but to extend our selves for the sake of our brothers.  The second half of verse seven says, ?When you see the naked, that you cover him, and not hide yourself from your own flesh??  The desire to hide from our own flesh is a secret catalyst in the resistance to repentance.  It is time to rise above it.</p>\n<p>The attitude the Lord is attempting to release in us is for redemption.  Those who focus on how different they are from transgressors have totally missed the point.  As such, there remains a fixed gulf between the Saints and identified transgressors.  Believers are denying their own flesh and, for fear of being exposed, keep their distance from transgressors.  But there is coming an army who will embrace this sin sick society and repent as though the sins were their very own.  They will invade society with brokenness and humility knowing that each sinner is a captive not very different from themselves.  A line of Kevin Prosch?s song ?King of Saint?s says, ?Who ever heard of an army O Lord, that conquered the earth through weeping and mourning and brokenness?\'  It speaks of a nation of people who are aware of themselves as much as they are the forgiving power of Christ.</p>\n<h4>Who He is!</h4>\n<p>The second key to repentance is found in a revelation of who He is.  True repentance cannot be arrived at until ?who we are? meets ?who He is?.  At its very core, humility is connected to truth.  The truth of our greatness or weakness can only come when the grand expanse of possibilities is clearly laid out.  Pride is an illusion of who we are; a deception arrived at when we limit comparisons to a select controlled group.  For example if I want to believe I am a great musical talent when I am not, I will avoid playing with anyone better than myself.  I will create environments where I am superior and, whenever possible, create roadblocks to keep others from joining.  Many secular organizations, as well as church organizations, operate on these grounds while pretending to protect the integrity of the discipline they represent.</p>\n<p>The same is true in the area of sports.  You cannot know what kind of a tennis player you are if you only play against a wall.  You must come into contact with others to know where you are.  It is a vain thing to consider yourself great if you have never measured yourself against a standard besides your own self.  If you are the best, humility does not require denial, but it does require the truth that comes from reality.<br />In the area of righteousness, men compare themselves with other men, resulting in a false sense of righteousness.  Reality and truth can only come when we look to the ultimate standard ? the Lord Himself.  Without this unmovable and unchangeable standard we are lost in a sea of counterfeit comparisons.  Any sense of wellbeing arising from such comparisons is misplaced.  This, of course, is true whether we are a believer or not.  It is especially relevant should we desire to build or minister in His name.  How can we presume to build with a quality incompatible to His nature?  Thus, when it comes to serving God and fulfilling the desire of His heart, the first ingredient is a revelation of Him.  Without this we can only build out of the standard which is our-self.  No doubt we can please ourselves, and this is the trap we often fall into.  But on the other hand, if we actually aim to please Him, then He must be the measuring stick for our labor.  This is where repentance becomes a constant exercise.</p>\n<p>The weakness of men is found in the inability or unwillingness to be measured by the Lord.  Falling short is contrary to what human nature demands, and so we prefer to create our own standards.  Repentance is the outcome of having truly seen what we are capable of producing alongside what He actually requires.  This will be the point of division between those who are empowered with authority and those who fall behind.  The Lord will not trust the building of His house to workmen who refuse His measure.  It is not a question of giftedness or skill; it is a question humility and brokenness.  Will this generation of the Church come under the Word of the Lord?  The ways, means, and standards that were passable yesterday cannot work today.</p>\n<p>The scope and quality of the task at hand will be defined by the Lord Himself.  If it is defined or measured against what others have done, we will fall short of His intended purpose.  However, if we hope to build what is beyond ourselves, we will continually draw near to discover who He is.  As such, repentance cannot end.  The desire to repent will deepen the more we discover Him.  His presence will form in us an expectation which human strength, ingenious invention, and talent cannot satisfy.  When we have truly seen what the Lord yearns to do alongside the human inclination to build according to lesser standards, repentance will come easy.</p>'),(9,'Whom Do You Serve','<p>There exists a tension between the extremes of serving men and serving God.  While on one hand we are called to be a blessing to men, there is no guarantee that blessing men is equal to serving God.  That is, our efforts to help men, even if done in the name of the Lord, may actually be contrary to serving the Lord.  The calling of God must be understood as a calling to serve the Lord and not men.  Yet, if we truly serve the Lord we will find ourselves serving men in the purest sense.  It is when man is free from the compulsion to serve men can he truly be a blessing.  While this may look like a contradiction, it is a paradox which distinguishes Christianity from the deceptive foe we call Humanism.</p>\n\n<h4>Abraham</h4>\n<p>When the Lord called Abraham it was very clear that the initiative was from the Lord\'s side.  It was God who commanded Abraham to leave his family and follow the Lord.  As an outcome of Abraham\'s obedience, he would be blessed and would become a blessing. </p>\n<p>\'Get out of your country, from your family and from father\'s house, to a land that I will show you. I will make you a great nation; I will bless you and make your name great; and you shall be a blessing. I will bless those who bless you, and I will curse him who curses you; and in you all the families of the earth shall be blessed.\'(Genesis 12:2-3)</p>\n<p>The promise reveals the Lord\'s intention to do the blessing.  \'I will bless you and make you great; and you shall be a blessing.\'  Abraham was not commanded to go out and bless the people.  Rather, he was simply called to follow and serve the Lord.  This distinction is not subtle or slight. It is the beginning of the great gulf separating Christianity from mere humanism. Abraham was not asked to bless the nations, since only the Lord can bless them.  Indeed, it is the pride of man which convinces him he can do good. Herein is Christ and antichrist.  Christ is the Lord\'s answer to men\'s evil; \'good works\' are men\'s empty and vain attempts to justify and redeem himself.  This is in effect a rejection of Jesus.</p>\n<p>This raises a question for the believer: Which of our works come from our union with Jesus, and which come out of an unbelieving and defiled heart?  They may look the same on the surface, but there is a world of difference between them.  The end of one is life; the other brings death.  As the scripture declares, \'There is a way which seems right to a man, but the end of it are the ways of death.\'(Pro 14:12) </p>\n<p>The issue is not the question of words and phrases, but an orientation focused on either the desire of the Lord or the needs of men.  Human compassion has a focus on man which appears to be compassionate and caring.  But the reality is this: Everything which is not rooted and initiated by Jesus is an act of rebellion against Him.  Therefore, good is limited to \'what comes out of Jesus\'.  Even the branch which was once attached and is now severed from Him, is fit to be cast into the fire.(John 15:1-3)  Romans puts it this way, \'Whatever is not of faith is sin\'. (Rom. 14:12)  Or to phrase it another way: \'Whatever activities do not come from a restful knowing that Jesus was good enough for all my shortcomings, is sin.\'  Meaning, when unworthiness, guilt, my need of acceptance and recognition etc., propel my effort to do good, the outcome is evil.</p>\n<p>Humanism then, is a rejection of Jesus and an insult to His death.  It is man\'s attempt to be good outside of Jesus.  It will not and cannot be good!  It is the good side of the tree of knowledge; the same tree which brought us sin and which daily stands as the rival of the tree of Life.  Remember,\'flesh produces flesh and spirit produces spirit\' .  If you feed a hungry man from a tree whose fruit is poison, you may think you have done well, but you obviously have not.  Though God can make us a blessing, what we generate from ourselves will never bless.  The Lord is not asking us to bless, He is asking us to believe Him.  As He said, \'This is the work of God, that you believe on Him whom He has sent.\' (John 6:29)  Humanism is an orientation toward man, Christianity looks to Jesus.</p>\n<h4>Paul</h4>\n<p>Paul possessed a clear understanding of this world\'s evil.  While through his writing he is to this day a blessing, he understood the danger of trying to be a \'blessing\' to men.</p>\n<p>\'For do I now persuade men, or God? or do I seek to please men? for if I yet pleased men, I should not be the servant of Christ.\'(Galatians 1:10)</p>\n<p>Paul makes it clear, the one who seeks to please men cannot serve Christ.  The idea of \'serving men\' may sound noble and innocent enough, but self hides at the center.  Behind supposed good intentions is a deceptive \'self-serving\' ambition.  The problem with \'self\' is that it serves man with the express desire to obtain credit.  In some form or another it requires payment.  It is not freely given! It may not want money, but it needs a return; be it honor, recognition, appreciation or love.  While it is not wrong for us to express appreciation when we have been served, service to the Lord neither asks nor wants man\'s reward.  Any anticipation from man reveals whom we are truly serving.</p>\n<p>In this respect, the religious community of Christ\'s day most certainly served men.  It was this issue which stirred the scorn and contempt of our Lord.  On the surface the deeds of the Pharisee\'s differed little from those of the righteousness.  What betrayed them was their assertions of righteousness and their need of honor. (Mt 23:27 )  This deceptive hypocricy sickened Jesus more than the obvious sins of the prostitutes and tax collectors.  Therefore, revealing \'false righteousness\' is foremost in the Lord\'s effort to train us in true righteousness.</p>\n<h4>What does it look like?</h4>\n<p>False righteousness can be known by the fruit it produces in our hearts.  Remember, \'...by their fruit you shall know them.\'  False righteousness brings a tremendous sense of wellbeing.  Self can milk a good deed for days; basking in it\'s glow while replaying the deed and remembering those appreciative words.  \'Brother/Sister, that was such a wonderful thing you did.\'  It loves to be noticed and rewarded. It is jealous and possessive of it\'s own praise and secretly despises sharing honor with another.  If it suspects others are gleaning from its labors, it harbors bitter resentment.  It is harsh; critical; sectarian; smug; easily offended, especially when not receiving proper payment for its sacrifice.  It can be easily detected when it presumes whom the Lord may bless.  It feels particularly deserving of the Lord\'s favor based on the noble service it has rendered.  Again, it is not a righteousness based on faith, but upon works.  As such, it seems right to a man, but its paths are the paths of spiritual death.</p>\n<p>False righteousness begins out of a presumption about our own ability to be and do good.  Paul labored to escape the power of such righteousness declaring his desire to \'...be found in Him (Jesus), not having a righteousness, which is of the law, but that which is through the faith of Christ, the righteousness which is of God by faith:\'.(Phil. 3:9)  Like Paul, we are coming to a place where our righteousness is purely from above.  This will become reality when we are trained to know the false from the true.  Working through this process may be what Paul meant when he said, \'work out our salvation with fear and trembling\'.  Jesus was certainly clear on this point and did not entertain \'false goodness\' from Himself or those around Him.  <br />Jesus</p>\n<p>His ministry was an obvious blessing, but may seem inconsistent to the natural minded man.  For example after feeding the poor he gladly allowed the equivalent of a years salary worth of perfume to be dumped on his feet.  Judas, being naturally minded and unable to understand, objected.  But Jesus deflected Judas\' objections saying, \'For the poor always ye have with you; but me ye have not always.\' (John 12:8)  Jesus was not being extravagant, He simply had other priorities.  His ministry was not directed to the poor, it was to the Lord.  Had His primary calling been to care for the poor, utter frugality would have been vital.  But He was not focused on the immediate requirement of men, he was focused on the present will of His Father. <br />Jesus encouraged the believers to care for the poor, but was not limited by the perspective of caring for the poor.  He was known to be compassionate but was not always kind.  He certainly was not kind to the religious leaders.  On one occasion he equated a Canaanite woman to a dog.  Right before her face yet! Culture aside, this still does not look like compassion.  The point is if we seek to serve men with out human definition of good we will never become the blessing we are meant to be.  Consider this as a pattern to follow.  The preincarnate Christ, led Joshua and the armies of Israel to destroy entire city\'s of men, women and children in the conquest of Canaan.  Is the God of the Old Testament the same God in the New?  Absolutely, neither His nature, nor His goals have changed.  \'He is the same yesterday, today and forever.\' (Heb. 13:8)  For this the humanist despises the God of scripture.</p>\n<p>The humanist is limited in his capacity to think and so has defined \'good\' which does not agree with Jesus. Like the Pharisee he is \'self-righteous.  His self-righteousness differs from the Pharisee since he does not believe in the idea of the God of scripture, but His error is the same.  He believes himself to be inherantly good, living out his goodness by doing what is honorable to men.  His deception is the lie which tells him he serves for the sake of others.  This lie corrupts his wisdom leading him to accuse God as unrighteous and cruel.  In his words he cannot \'... believe in a God who sends good people to a fiery hell\'.  Again, his own sense of right is exalted above the Lord. When similar sympathies live in our heart it is a testimony to our state.  This should not condemn us, but open our understanding to where the Lord is breaking and molding our hearts.  Since the foolishness of God is wiser than men the Lord is bringing us into the wisdom of Jesus. <br />Therefore, the success of of our walk will hinge largely on our understanding of the principle which states, \'that which is born of the flesh is flesh and that which is born of spirit is spirit\'. (John 3:6)  This tells us their are only two sources: The spirit or the flesh. Seeing this, Jesus could not live by what He thought was right.  He even prayed in the garden \'... not my will but yours be done\'.  Though He was highly moral and deeply principled, He was not guided by principle or moral in His ministry.  He knew His own thinking could not be trusted.  And so He lived by every Word which proceeded from His Father\'s mouth.  He did what He did because that is what He saw the Father doing: Not generally, but specifically!  Though he healed the sick and fed the poor, he did so as a by-product of following the Lord and not as a goal.  His life and ministry was a daily relationship, responding to the ongoing guidance of the Holy Spirit.  This was His only guarantee that what He did was truly good. </p>\n<p>\'Jesus said to them, My meat is to do the will of him that sent me, and to finish his work.\'(John 4:34)  <br />\'For I came down from heaven, not to do my own will, but the will of him that sent me.\'(John 6:38) <br />We can study the words and works of Jesus, copy them as perfectly as is humanly possible, and still not serve the Lord for a moment.  If we live by what men understand to be compassion, we will not find ourselves being like Jesus.  We will find ourselves to be the equivalent of a Christian-humanist; siding with both their doubts and questions.  Some wonder where the theology of some of our major denominations went wrong.  It is not when they accepted homosexuality as an acceptable lifestyle, nor is it when they denied the inerrancy of Scripture.  It began when they failed to see the difference between Biblical righteousness by faith, and \'good works\' as determined by man.  The departure from God began when they chose to serve the perceived need of man, not realizing it would lead them into direct conflict with the Almighty Christ.  When you move in the natural, you will produce what is natural.  Even if it seems good, it is of this world and from the standpoint of God, utterly corrupt.</p>\n<h4>The True Path</h4>\n<p>Of course this leaves us with some significant questions.  For example, \'How do we serve the Lord?\'.  Since we cannot make ourselves a blessing, \'how do we apply what we know?\'.  The anwer is simple: We do what we know to be right at the time.  This will change depending on our maturity and distinct purpose.  The Lord will lead us through a unique school of training.  As we apply ourselves to obedience He will reveal pride and self-righteousness in our heart, increasingly purifying both our works and our hearts.  The beauty is in the security of knowing we are children of the Most High and joint-heirs of Christ throughout the entire process.  Though there is a ongoing pattern of repentance we know our end and our place.  The practical outcome will be an increasingly clear view of true and false righteousness.  Like Jesus, our spiritual training becomes the foundation for a walk of obedience in the spirit.  For, \'though he were a Son, yet learned he obedience by the things which he suffered;\'. (Heb 5:8)  It is important for us to realize that His capacity to discern the Lord\'s will did not come overnight.  His three years of ministry were built on the foundation of the first thirty. </p>\n<p>\'And he went down with them, and came to Nazareth, and was subject unto them: but his mother kept all these sayings in her heart. and Jesus increased in wisdom and stature, and in favor with God and man.\'(Luke 2:51-52)</p>\n<p>At twelve years old Jesus demonstrated an understanding of His place and purpose, and yet He still made himself subject to His parents.  It was here that He learned the voice of His Father.  Through the common process of life, and under the covering of Joseph\'s authority, He learned the ways of the Spirit of God.  He went to the Synagogue, memorized scripture, prayed in secret, and learned the craft of a carpenter.  None of these things were in vain. Likewise the Lord will use both natural and spiritual authority as a part of our training.</p>\n<p>My own training began with a strong commitment to being everything I could be.  Though I initially realized a certain amount of success in the eyes of myself and others, the training was just beginning.  The Lord then began to strip my works to their raw state, exposing their very origin: the true motives of my heart.  No one but God can do that. It was at this point that I began to see not everything was as it appeared on the surface.  This training continues to this day.  The training itself is the dividing between soul and spirit; between flesh and spirit; between God and man; between ultimate good and ultimate evil.  Though I am not sure when or if the end will ever come, the outcome in terms of fruit is evident.  The Lord is intent on making us a blessing.  If we can see the difference between serving men and serving God, we will have begun to be that blessing.</p>\n<p>Christianity is not the application of our abilities, energies and resources, towards what we consider to be righteous and godly works, though there is certainly a place for this.  Christianity is the life of a man or woman, who is walking with and serving the Lord.  If this is done honestly and with a good heart, mankind will be well served.  As the proverb declares, \'The path of the righteous is like the light of dawn it shine brighter and brighter until the full day.\'  As we look over the history of our ministry and service, the very beginning will appear as darkness compared to what is seen in the full light of day.</p>'),(10,'True vs Truth','<p />Revealed truth brings a powerful freedom.  The truth may tell of our selfish hearts or unveil depths of God\'s bountiful love.  It is sometimes harsh and sometimes gentle -- too broad and diverse to be classified by it\'s content or tone.  On the other hand there is a knowledge whose power will bind.  Genesis calls it the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.  The good of this tree inflates to produce pride, while the evil side\n\nbelittles to self loathing.  Though the knowledge may be in fact true, it is death.  Both the good and the evil are fruit of the same tree; both will enslave us.  Our salvation and hope is found not in what is true, but in \'The Truth\'.</p>\n<h4>The Knowledge of Good and Evil</h4>\n<p>Jesus said that we would know the truth and that it would set us free.  Natural knowledge may consist of what is \'true\', but it is not \'truth\'.  The Hebrew word for truth is \'emet\'. Emet is derived from the verb \'aman\' which means \'to be firm, permanent, and established.\'  The key words which define \'truth\' are \'permanent and established\'.  Seeing as the creation will be destroyed when \'the heavens will pass away with a great noise, and the elements will melt with fervent heat\' (2 Peter 3:10) it cannot qualify as permanent or established.  Neither is that which is learned from our surroundings qualify as \'truth\'.  All that is derived from a study of creation may testify or reflect the form of what is true, but is not truth itself.  Thus there is \'Truth\' -- that which is permanently established, and there it \'true\'. - that which we individually deem to be right as a result of our interaction with the world.</p>\n<p>Our natural knowledge has two opposite extemes which are two sides of the same coin.  The two sides are so distinct it is sometimes difficult to see that they are really only one.  They are known as the knowledge of good and the knowledge of evil(Gen. 2:17).  Man pursues the good side of knowledge believing life\'s problems are the product of \'low self-esteem\' (the knowledge of evil).  He therefore seeks personal affirmation, encouragement and all forms of positive reinforcement to empower him.  Since these negative forces (the knowledge of evil) have held him back, he looks for the opposite extreme.  How cruel and ironic that the opposite extreme is actually fruit of the same tree.  It does not deliver, it only changes the dynamic of the deception.</p>\n<p>In reality everything in creation is subject to spiritual darkness and can offer nothing of real virtue.  This darkness is simply the absence of true good.  Demons, by manipulating imaginary standards of \'right\', \'wrong\', \'love\' and \'hate\', delude men into thinking they are fighting to minimize their bad impulses to release their good.  Whereas they are hopelessly bound to selfishly serve themselves, they believe every display of positive affection reveals innate goodness.  \'Because I love my dog and cry when children are abused, I am therefore good.\'  Their minds, darkened by this illusion of love and hate, are actually held captive of a spiritual \'virtual reality\', manipulated by forces beyond their understanding.</p>\n<p>We need deliverance from this false \'good\'.  Jesus promised the truth would set us free.  He really meant freedom from the knowledge of good and evil -- an alternate reality called the kingdom of darkness.  In exchange for the knowledge of good and evil we are introduced to God -- that is, the knowledge of God.  He Himself is the defining power of His kingdom.</p>\n<p>\'For it is God who commanded light to shine out of darkness, who has shone in our hearts to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ.\' (2 Corinthians 4:6)</p>\n<p>\'He has delivered us from the power of darkness and conveyed us into the kingdom of the Son of His love.\' (Colossians 1:13)</p>\n<p>Since the fall, man is alienated from God who alone is good.  The scripture tells us He is love. In the absence of a knowledge of God, man cannot know love or good, and so defines his own sense of good and evil.  Unfortunately his only frame of reference is himself.  Led about by the passions of his own soul he misinterprets the positive passions as being \'love\'.  In reality he only loves what brings him pleasure: Cuddly babies; attractive persons; friends who welcome him; and anything else which comforts him or gives a sense of significance.  His affections then are the product of the \'love of himself\'.  He loves because there is a perceived return.  But love of self is nothing other than selfishness.  Since these passions are literally the outflow of selfishness, his so called \'love\' can quickly turn to hatred when it is spurned or satisfied.  Consider as a graphic example the story of Amnon and Tamar.</p>\n<h4>Amnon & Tamar</h4>\n<p>Amnon, one of sons of King David, was a half brother to Absalom and his sister Tamar.  Amnon became so consumed (in love) with Tamar that he became sick and depressed.  Probably uttering the words \'Love hurts\', he wallows in self-pity contemplating his pain.  He is then goaded by a tricky friend to formulate a plan to get Tamar alone in his bedroom, where he can physically express his undying \'love\'.  After having his way with her his love quickly and magically changes to hatred.</p>\n<p>\'Then Amnon hated her exceedingly, so that the hatred with which he hated her was greater than the love with which he had loved her.\'  (2 Samuel 13:15)</p>\n<p>Amnon was not moved by genuine love, but a close facsimile.  He possessed the power of desire, which however cleverly masked, is only the \'good\' side of the knowledge of good and evil.  Since this positive passion comes from the same tree as the knowledge of evil (negative passion) the two can quickly shift for they are actually one in the same.  This explains the nature of \'love hate\' relationships, or at least why this dichotomy can co-exist.  Amnon, like countless others, believed in the sincerity of his deceiving and fickle passions.</p>\n<h4>The Word of Life</h4>\n<p>As with Amnon the knowledge of good as well as the knowledge of evil will lead to bondage, though the fruit of its slavery may look very different.  Those primarily bound by the good of the tree of knowledge are full of arrogant self-righteous pride.  Their worth does not emerge from their creator but from a false sense of control.  Those unable to consistently reach the \'good\' fall to the other side becoming non-achievers with poor motivation and little self-worth.  These are driven to by a deep sense of self-loathing and lean toward destructive behaviours.  The non-achiever and the pompous fool are in the same predicament.  They are utterly cut off from anything good and virtuous.  Though, ironically, it is the non-achiever who is closer to the truth.</p>\n<p>The only path to deliverance is in the Word of LIFE.  Since the Word is sent to reveal God, it is the avenue to all truth and goodness.  Of course when we say the Word of God, we are not referring to the written letter which can kill, but to the living Word. (2 Corinthians 3:6 Who also has made us able ministers of the new testament; not of the letter, but of the spirit: for the letter kills, but the spirit gives life.)  What is true can kill as easily as error.  When what is Biblically true is released without the Spirit of Life, it is the knowledge of good and will eventually bring death.  When what is true is powered by the life of Christ it becomes The Truth (Jesus) -- the Living Word.</p>\n<p>\'For the word of God is living and powerful, and sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing even to the division of soul and spirit, and of joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart.\' (Hebrews 4:12)</p>\n<p>Ultimately the living Word is Jesus revealed.  Christ revealed is a two-edged sword who will give us life for the death of the tree of knowledge.  The two-edged sword has an edge for each of the fruit. One edge for the good -- one edge for the evil.  One side of truth communicates mercy and grace for those struggling under the power of self loathing -- the knowledge of evil. It is a message of reconciliation!  However, it is not just a message but an attribute of God Himself which is being released.  The other edge of the sword reveals a holy and just God who resists the proud and self-righteous.  The forgiveness given to the adulteress and the scathing rebuke to the religious leaders were both the Word of Life.  Both are aspects of God\'s own nature.  The knowledge of God brought by the Word of Life is the unveiling of God Himself.  It does not educate, it conforms us into the same image.</p>\n<h4>In the Church</h4>\n<p>The knowledge of good and evil mirrors divine truth.  It deceives us into believing we are in possession of a truth when we only have a close facsimile.  A form of truth is never as good as \'the truth\'. One defines God while the other unveils God Himself.  The difference surfaces in the fruit that each bears.</p>\n<p>The knowledge of God\'s mercy delivers us from the accusing power of guilt and condemnation.  The knowledge of good masquerades as this truth by declaring God to be kind and forgiving.  However, such declarations never lead us to mercy.  Instead we are left to our own devices, groping in the dark as we try to live out what amounts to a definition of mercy.  So artificial is this knowledge that it cannot merge with attributes of the Lord\'s nature with seem to be on the opposite side.  When there is no living understanding of mercy, it is impossible to accept the Lord who is the Judge.  While what is true concerning God\'s mercy may not be reconciled with His judgment, the truth of His mercy fits very well.  As the Psalmist said, \'Mercy and truth are met together\' (Ps. 85:10).</p>\n<p>When we truly know Him we can treasure the entire panorama of His character without confusion.  Encountering Him who is mercy empowers us to be merciful, without impeding our ability to see His judgment.  The living Word gives us a literal entrance into the river of mercy.  Indeed there is a voice which speaks what is true which cannot release the Truth.  It brings a stagnant lifeless form of godliness without power.  Whereas the truth delivers us, what is true can easily be the binding power of mere knowledge.  Jesus told us his words were Spirit and they were Life.</p>\n<p>\'It is the Spirit who gives life; the flesh profits nothing. The words that I speak to you are spirit, and they are life.\' (John 6:63)</p>\n<p>Jesus had just spoken a difficult message which had the appearance of evil to the Hebrew. (ie.\'Eat my flesh and drink my blood.\')  Without trying to clarify his meaning He instead suggested they recognize his words to be the truth since they were Spirit and Life.  He was trying to teach them to detect the LIFE and the SPIRIT.  Accustomed to handling and interacting with the scriptures through their intellect only, had made them presume to know the Lord\'s essence.  However their knowledge of what was \'true\' could not be reconciled with His \'truth\'.  His words appeared to contradict known scripture.  Their use of the Biblical text was the knowledge of good and evil -- a form of what was true.  As such it was stiff and rigged with death.  A form of what is \'true\' will always blind us to the \'Truth\'.</p>\n<h4>A Pattern of Deception</h4>\n<p>Both the knowledge of good and the knowledge of evil are being presented in the Church as divine truth.  Believers vacillate between a knowledge which belittles and a knowledge which inflates, only occasionally experiencing the Word of Life.  The journey between these two expressions of carnal knowledge keeps believers distracted and frustrated.  Amazingly, it is a simple faith which can preserve us.  The more experience we have in the Christian life the more opportunity we have for falling away from true life into the knowledge of good or evil.</p>\n<p>It usually begins when we become attracted to a particular style of ministry, be it \'fire and brimstone\' or \'quiet and subdued\'.  \'Why do they have to yell?\', one will ask while another wants them to \'speak with authority\'.  While the true Word can come through either expression, we become accustomed to a preferred style.  This preference leads us away from the living waters until we become dry and empty.  Increasingly dissatisfied we eventually come across an anointed Word in the opposite style.  We then embrace this alternate form not realizing it was the life and spiritwhich touched us so deeply.  It is neither the new slant, the clarity of presentation or the force of the message which gives life.  The tone or theme of the message is only the container for the spirit and life.  When we are distracted by the container we will eventually become susceptible to \'death\' simply because it is delivered in the preferred style. <br />Believers are continually being seduced by an imitation of the truth. Indeed Satan comes as an Angel of Light.  Whereas the Word of Life would reveal Jesus as Judge, the counterfeit declares judgment without revealing Christ.  The result is sorrow which does not lead to life.  \'For godly sorrow produces repentance leading to salvation, not to be regretted; but the sorrow of the world produces death.\'(2 Cor. 7:10)  The final fruit of the knowledge of evil is self-loathing, whereas the fruit of the knowledge of of good is self-love.  Both are Self centered -- both will produce death!</p>\n<p>The truth mirrored in the message surrounding the knowledge of evil is important to underline.  For the revelation of the glory of God and His Holiness will bring about the response of Isaiah: \'Woe am I\'.  The revelation of one\'s sinfulness by the life of the Spirit brings opportunity for real change.  On the other hand the spirit of condemnation will only make us feel bad.  It is common for those infected by condemnation to reject the revelation of their sinfulness, even when it comes by the Spirit of life.  The error is made in the assumption declaring \'anything which causes me pain must be evil\'.  A diet of worldly sorrow makes it very difficult to accept godly sorrow.  The sorrow which leads to life which is genuinely painful, but it must not be avoided -- it is the pain and death of the cross.</p>\n<p>If we use the criteria of the knowledge of good and evil we will be deceived.  The knowledge of good is the letter of the law which produces pride.  It\'s message will excuse sin while seeking to release us into \'human potential\'.  Ultimately it produces Christianity without responsibility.  The knowledge of evil condemns.  It seeks to define a pathway of success without giving power to succeed.  Dead works will result.  Both the knowledge of good and evil can appear very Biblical as Satan himself quoted the scriptures to Jesus.  We are freed from this tyranny only by hearing the Shepherd\'s voice.</p>\n<h4>The Shepherd\'s Voice</h4>\n<p>Before the fall, God would come and speak to man.  Everything man needed could come through His encounter with the Lord.  It was not necessary for man to know the difference between good and evil.  Knowing the Lord, who is Good, would provide that knowledge.  Jesus restores us in this relationship and once again speaks.</p>\n<p>\'To him the doorkeeper opens, and the sheep hear his voice; and he calls his own sheep by name and leads them out. And when he brings out his own sheep, he goes before them; and the sheep follow him, for they know his voice. Yet they will by no means follow a stranger, but will flee from him, for they do not know the voice of strangers.\' (John 10:3-5)</p>\n<p>Knowing His voice is the key to freedom.  When we are seeking the Shepherd we must learn to distinguish between His voice and the voice of another.  When Jesus speaks to us in a harsh tone it does mean that every harsh voice is from Him.  When He speaks gently to us it is not to suggest that every gentle voice is from Him.  The same Jesus has spoken harshly that has spoken softly.  To properly know His voice we must know the sound and not just the tone or the content.  The same  Jesus who spoke of mercy can speak of judgement.  How easily believers become seduced by another spirit which will mirror familiar patterns. <br />\'But I fear, lest by any means, as the serpent beguiled Eve through his subtilty, so your minds should be corrupted from the simplicity that is in Christ.\' (2 Corinthians 11:3)</p>\n<p>Eve was beguiled from the simplicity of Christ by the knowledge of good and evil.  Huge segments of the Body of Christ have left the Lord to trust in their own experience and acquired knowledge.  It is commonly believed that more learning can keep us from error.  We should behold the children!  Any six month child can distinguish the voice of his parents.  If these children were left to divide between right and wrong they would have no hope.  Instead all they need do is know the speaking voice of their fathers and mothers.  Our hope is in knowing His voice.  Nothing else is required for obedience.  Lean not on your own understanding, but trust in the Lord.</p>'),(11,'Thoughts on Vision','<p />Since the beginning of our ministry many people have asked us to define our vision,  which has always been a problem unless I could speak in extremely general terms. This is in spite of the fact that over the past 10 to 15 years a great deal has been said about vision.  We have been told what it is to have a vision, the fact we need a vision and how to get a vision, while being given numerous approaches dealing with the\n\nimplementation of a vision.  But please do not misunderstand me!  I believe it is wonderful and right to have a vision provided the vision is from the Lord.  Unfortunately, we have given ourselves far too much latitude when it comes to determining what it is we have been called to do.</p>\n<h4>The Challenge</h4>\n<p>The problem arises partly on account of the pressure to define a vision in terms others can understand, which is not always possible.  Our popular Christian culture has told us that in order to be successful, you must secure the support of the masses through an accurate and exciting presentation of your specific goals.  I wonder how Abraham did when he was asked to explain where he was headed.  John the Baptist thought it sufficient to define himself as the ?voice of one crying in the wilderness?.  It strikes me that even Joseph, while having a vague idea of his ultimate destiny, did not have a clue how or when it would unfold.  It seems the overwhelming majority of Biblical heroes of the faith were called to walk a path they could only partially understand.  On the one hand compelled to take a journey into the wonderful purposes of God, but on the other hand, never being entirely sure what the final outcome would be.</p>\n<p>This is not to say we cannot formulate a framework for living.  Neither does it mean we cannot have an idea of what we must do after graduating from college or High School.  However, there exists the underlying implication that as believers, we are not permitted to dream and plan as the world does which is according to the whims of an ambitiously driven personality, talent or passion.  We need to realize that those called to follow the Lord in ministry, are often unable to define with precision, what they are destined to accomplish. Therefore, the pitfalls of making bold declarations regarding goals and aims, is that they can be premature, misguided and presumptuous. </p>\n<p>For Watchman on the Wall Ministries and my driven personality this has been a constant challenge.  On the one hand knowing the unmistakable call to follow the Lord, without ever really knowing where it would bring us, how it will come about, or even when it would unfold.  The unfortunate fact notwithstanding, that I was never without a plan of action of my own making, and exceedingly ready to lead the charge with the cry, ?Follow me Jesus!?.  Thus, to my surprise, the Lord has used the first 10 years of our ministry to erase any confidence that my training, intelligence, sense of timing, or passion were either dependable or necessary for the work Wendy and I were called to carry out something I dare say He is still working on.  Yet, from the very moment the Lord spoke to me something was planted in my spirit which has given me the faith to embark on this journey and endure it?s hardships.</p>\n<h4>The Calling</h4>\n<p>It was in 1989 when the Lord spoke to me out of Ezekiel 3:17, saying Son of man I have called you as a watchman for the house of Israel (Canada), hear a Word from My mouth and give them warning from me.  In that moment I saw something I cannot describe.  But it was enough to carry through 12 years of flesh-mortifying trial, punctuated with awesome revelations of the grace, mercy and power of Jesus Christ.  This is not to say I have arrived, since I can only be aware of two things:  The ultimate destination, which I cannot define but feel I know, and the road thus far traveled.  Thankfully, our success does not lie in the breadth of current understanding, but our faith in the awesome wisdom of a God who promised He would accomplish in us, what His grace began.</p>\n<p>During these shaping years I often heard others talk in very specific terms about their vision, and wondered when or if mine would become clearer.  That is, while I had a glimpse of something fantastic and real in my future, it did not come with specific goals.  In my weakness I sought for goals I thought would more clearly define who I had been called to be and what I had been called to do.  Thus, the goals I adopted were ones I formulated myself, using what I understood were my gifts and the grid of contemporary ministry presently available.  However, in the face of the Lord?s chastening, I could not hold to my own works, and they quickly faded like faint vapors or smoke before the gust of a strong wind. </p>\n<p>Meanwhile, others saw universities, large churches and elaborate enterprises.  Though I longed for such a commission, I received nothing other than the Word of the Lord for the present moment.  As I look back I see that the substance of truth contained in His word was the only thing of real substance.  As Jeremiah declared, ?What is the chaff to the wheat. </p>\n<p>These Words, which I turned into articles, were not instructions for something I was to build, but a reflection of the heart of the Father for His children the unveiling of the ways of God.  In the context of the culture of the Church this was not sufficient to qualify as a vision.  To be honest, there were times when I longed for something much more tangible; something which could be felt, measured and appreciated by others.  Yet, the Lord was faithful to encourage Wendy and I as we persisted in seeking the face of the Lord.</p>\n<h4>The Promise</h4>\n<p>Throughout this journey the Lord was doing a significant and deep work within my heart.  In a phrase, Christ was increasing and I was decreasing.  At the same time various prophetic words would come from different sources affirming our direction in the journey.  This was critical since we could not see where we were going.  All I knew was that, like Abraham the Lord had sent us on a journey, where and when we would arrive was not for us to determine.  Like Joshua the Lord has admonished us to stay near His heart as we have never been this way before.  Still certain promises would glow in my spirit reminding me of what was yet to come; For the earth will be filled with the knowledge of the glory of the Lord as the waters cover the sea (Habakkuk 2:14).  In general terms I have known that my role in the Church is related to this prophetic promise.  Knowing this has helped keep me focused on the long term vision, though vague and something of a mirage somewhere off in the distance. </p>\n<p>Even so, the weakness of my flesh caused me to perceive what was meant to be temporary as the place of fulfillment and final resting point in our journey.  Like Joseph, I had come to believe ruling in Potiphar?s house was my ultimate destination.  Only to be surprised again and again.  Thankfully, the Lord was faithful to frustrate and dismantle everything which He was not building.  Indeed it is hard to build the house if the Lord is not building.</p>\n<p>Now, having said all that, it has become clear to us we are in an important period of transition.  To use the metaphor of this journey, we have come to yet another rise in the landscape, but instead of endless wasteland, there is something on the horizon with shape and structure.  Like every traveler, we begin our journey having a picture of what we are seeking.   The actual substance of that illusive thing, does not come into view until we are almost upon it.  It brings to mind the many times I have traveled to other cities.  The mileage signs tell you the city is getting closer and closer.  What the city looks like in real life cannot be articulated until you are at the very threshold.  At that point you can define much more specifically.  In our journey we are as yet not close enough to be able to determine the specifics, but we have a increasing sense things are about to become much clearer.  Even so, our calling may never have the structured goals others have been called to achieve.  Nevertheless, like Abraham, we seek a city whose foundations are built by the Lord (Hebrews 11:10).</p>\n<h4>The Ultimate Vision</h4>\n<p>Consequently, our deepest fellowship belongs to those who have seen what we have seen, and wait as we wait.  Not aimlessly wandering or foolishly squandering today?s lessons, but absorbing each moment of trial and testing, knowing they are the mortar which makes for tomorrow?s building.  Remembering that no matter what we are called to assemble in terms of initiatives, these are only the scaffolding for what He is building.  And what is He building?  Us!  We are God?s building, His dwelling place, built on the foundation of apostles and prophets (Ephesians 2:20-22).  And as deep calls unto deep, even the talk of such things resonates with agreement in the spirit of those who long for what the Spirit of God is about to do.  <br />Unlike the human plans we can draw up for ourselves the Lord has been drawing us near to his heart to hear His vision.  As such, it will not be something I am doing or another is doing.  But it has it?s relevance only as being part of the whole.  It is not exclusively my ministry or that of another, it is the Lords!  Still, each of us are going to have a different role to play.  Determining your proper role is vital and something only the Lord can make clear to you.  I only know what part the Lord is calling me to be.  For the moment I am content to be another voice declaring, ?Make straight the way of the Lord.  Let every valley be lifted and every mountain be removed.  Lo, he is coming, He is coming, He is coming!  The Lord whom you seek will suddenly appear in His Temple?.  May the Lord make clear to you what part is yours, and may you faithfully pursue it with all your heart.</p>'),(12,'The Truth About Science and Our Universe','<p />\'O Timothy, keep that which is committed to your trust, avoiding profane and vain babblings, and oppositions of science falsely so called:\' (1Timothy 6:20) <br />Even in Paul\'s day men attempted to use science to undermine the truth of God in His universe.  What was Paul\'s response?  Ignore it!  Don\'t waste your time trying to prove something to those who want to lie to themselves.  He went so far as to say that this science was not science at all -- \'science--falsely so called\'.  In other words, \'don\'t get caught up trying to disprove so called science\'.  The fact is, in time, true science\n\nwill validate what we know to be true in the Lord.  We just need to give the scientist an opportunity to catch up to the Bible believer.  This he will do when given time, opportunity and a good conscience. <br />So then the problem with science is not so much science itself.  The problem is the scientist.  His evidence is usually trustworthy, but he has a bit of a problem interpreting it.  Because his mind is darkened by sin, it becomes a law to itself.  He cannot but make the information fit his bias.  When confronted with mountains of evidence he may be forced to change a little, but not without strident resistance.  Nevertheless, what is observable in the Universe, when properly understood, will always validate scripture.  Some recent observations by scientists in a National Geographic (Vol 185, No. 1 January 1994) edition demonstrate this fact.</p>\n<h4>Mysterious Gravitation</h4>\n<p>Two wonderful observations caught my attention.  The first reads as follows: <br />\'We have determined that our part of the universe is irresistibly sweeping toward some mysterious gravitational source whose location remains unknown.\'</p>\n<p>While it may be unknown to the scientific community, the final outcome is plainly clear in scripture.  In Revelations 22:13 Jesus declares, \'I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end, the first and the last.\'  As all things have come from Him all things have their finish in Him.  When the creation was formed it came from Him.  He spoke a word and the worlds came into being.  If there ever was a \'big bang\' it was not the random forces of nature at work, but a calculated act by the invincible Christ speaking the worlds into existence.  One can only imagine the incredible magnitude of the power at work in His Word.  As such, all things owe their existence to Him, and exist only because of the continuing power which He wields.  This fact is also boldly exclaimed, declaring:</p>\n<p>\'For by him were all things created, that are in heaven, and that are in earth, visible and invisible, whether they be thrones, or dominions, or principalities, or powers: all things were created by him, and for him; And he is before all things, and by him all things are held together\' (Colossians 1:16-17)</p>\n<p>In as much as He created all things and holds them together by the power of His word, He can be appropriately called the Center.  All things revolve around Him and do so by centrifugal forces not yet understood by man.  Since He is the author of creation and all things have come from Him, they will also return to Him.  \'All things are of Him, and through Him and to Him,...\'. (Romans 11:36)  In fact, the entire plan of redemption includes the return of creation to an order fully respecting who Christ is.  Both things spiritual and natural; things in heaven and on earth are being gathered into Him.  It is all part of the divine mystery now only partially unveiled to man, but spoken of throughout scripture.</p>\n<p>\'That in the dispensation of the fullness of times he might gather together in one all things in Christ, both which are in heaven, and which are on earth; even in him:\' (Ephesians 1:10)</p>\n<p>\'And, having made peace through the blood of his cross, by him to reconcile all things unto himself; by him, I say, whether they be things in earth, or things in heaven.\' (Colossians 1:20) </p>\n<p>It is the plan of God to bring all things together in direct and visible subjection of Jesus.  He has always been the reason and power behind creation.  Unfortunately men cannot understand this.  Sin has darkened their minds, rendering them incapable of clearly seeing His infinite might.  Until such time as God openly unveils the glorious greatness of Jesus they will be blind.  It is the mercy of God that science is gaining glimpses of that eternal greatness.  Shamefully, most will not have the understanding to properly interpret their data.  Their inability to see Christ and His glory is no doubt connected to the second observation recorded by National Geographic. </p>\n<h4>The Dark Matter</h4>\n<p>\'Increasingly, observations suggest that galaxies are immersed in huge halos of unseen material. We have no idea what this dark matter is, but theoretically it pervades our every breath, making up perhaps 99 percent of the mass of the universe. thus, everything we can see may be only the froth, the wispy one percent of the real universe.\' Bradford A. Smith -- National Geographic Vol 185, No.1 January 1994 <br />This quotation is not a reference to the vast unexplored regions of space.  It refers to unseen matter pervading our every breath.  That is, it exists within the sphere of our daily living.  The implication, for those who can accept the truth, suggests that it is not necessarily wise to accept as real everything which we can see and touch.  In the words of this scientist, what is observable may only be 1% of what is really there. <br />Throughout recent history natural science has in large part rested it\'s conclusions on the observable facts.  This led to Christianity being abandoned as \'unscientific\'.  The reality of an unseen realm was said to be based on superstition and folklore.  To this day the matter of faith has been ridiculed as \'unsophisticated\'.  \'How could we trust in what we could not see?\'  Rather, can you really trust what you see?  Again scripture prevails, declaring the foolishness of God to be wiser than men (1 Cor.1:25).</p>\n<p>Who then is foolish and who is wise?  Men have based their entire life\'s work on suppositions of so called science.  But science is not truly science by definition until all the facts are in.  Is it wise or foolish to base our judgment on a tiny portion of the information?  Yet, the arrogant pride of man continues to deceive him.  Proposing theories and philosophies, which must constantly be upgraded to meet new information, he defiantly rejects the knowledge of God.  Instead, he foolishly chooses to base his life on the wispy 1% of the mass of the universe.</p>\n<h4>The Solid Immaterial?</h4>\n<p>If the truth be known all of what we can see emerges from what we cannot.  Therefore what is most real exists, beyond what men now consider real.  If 99% of the real mass of the universe is not observable, where does that leave the one percent which seems so unmovable.  Probably the same place a bottle of Coke leaves the fizz.  Truly, science would have been far safer to stay relevant to Biblical truth.  Then we could have understood these things long ago.  For example the following passage has been around for close to 2000 years.</p>\n<p>\'Through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God, so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear.\' (Heb 11:3)</p>\n<p>Simply stated this says, \' What is seen is made out of what cannot be seen\'.  God, who is spirit, created the worlds by invisible matter.  We can apply this two ways.  First, the creation itself is formed of molecules which are not visible to the naked eye.  Secondly, and perhaps more profound, is the fact that there exists another dimension from which all the visible creation stems.  One could say the universe is the plant, but the unseen reality is the root.  In order of importance then the unseen realm takes preeminence.  The unseen is the life breadth of what can be observed.  For though the flower cannot live without the root, the root can always grow another flower.  Therefore we are exhorted not to place confidence in what can be seen.  Like the flower, it will quickly wither and pass away.</p>\n<p>\'While we look not at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen: for the things which are seen are temporal; but the things which are not seen are eternal.\' (2 Co 4:18)</p>\n<p>Looking to the unseen realm is true wisdom.  Anything else is utter foolishness.  As vast and grand as our universe may seem, it is really only the scaffolding of a new heaven and a new earth.  Imagine that if you can! All of the beauty of nature; the heavens and the brilliance of galaxies; are a transitionally resting place while we await the real universe\'s unfolding.  The temporary will always pale in comparison to the permanent.  They exist for one brief second, only to pass into oblivion. Unfortunately, the lives and existence of all who place their hope in it will pass away in similar futility.  Where is the wisdom of an artist whose canvas is a condemned building?  Better that we live our lives in hope of what is unseen.  This is indeed the true wisdom.</p>\n<h4>Superior Wisdom</h4>\n<p>Faith then is not the product of optimistic superstition.  It is an expression of superior wisdom.  It is the product of wisdom so high it is out of touch with human thinking.  Foolish men cannot help but ridicule it since it\'s very existence degrades and humbles them--something the proud cannot abide.  Yet, God has chosen to hide these things from the so called \'wise\', showing them to the simple of this world.  It is my sincere prayer that many in the scientific community will discover that the \'invisible things of him from the creation of the world, are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, even his eternal power and Godhead.\' (Romans 1:20)</p>'),(13,'The Spiritual Kingdom','<p />Good management means giving ourselves to our primary objectives.  We should be mostly doing what is mostly important.  Too much time and money is wasted, when secondary purposes are promoted above the primary objective.  In the cause of the Kingdom of God, secondary purposes are things like administrative systems and buildings.  These are not the goal but the means.  Our primary objective is increasing the\n\ndominion of the Kingdom of God.  The next question is vital -- that is, \'What gives increase to the Kingdom of God?\'  In effect -- \'What is true ministry?\'</p>\n<h4>Ministry Activity</h4>\n<p>Trying to answer this question can be confusing because only one thing can be considered true ministry.  Ministry occurs when the spirit and life of God are released.  The problem!?!  It cannot be seen.  Jesus said the \'kingdom of God comes without observation.  Neither shall they say, Lo here! or, lo there! for, behold, the kingdom of God is within you\'\' (Luke 17:20-21).  Since it occurs in secret, increasing the Kingdom is subtle and uneventful.  When the Lord came to Elijah there was wind which tore the rocks, an earthquake, and fire.  All of these things are obvious and noticeable.  But the Lord was not in them, He was in the still small voice.</p>\n<p>When the Kingdom of God increases there will be the cause and the effect.  The invisible power of God is the cause, while the effect is what is seen in the natural.  The things which are seen, such as Church programs and physical structures, can easily occupy our attention but they are not the Kingdom.  Nor does an increase in them suggest there was an increase in the Kingdom.  Programs which can be a conduit for Kingdom growth, can shroud our view of the real thing.  Because the wind and fire were so noticeable Elijah could have mistook them for the Lord Himself.  In like fashion, we can miss our first priority by focusing on secondary matters.</p>\n<p>It is easy for people to become devoted to the mechanisms of ministry (ie. programs, administration, facilities) without seeing the spiritual Kingdom.  New believers can involve themselves with the mechanics of Church life without knowing the true nature of ministry.  The mechanisms are natural and visible, while true ministry is spiritual and unseen.  Men are carnal(earthly minded) but the Kingdom is spiritual.  The carnal man can see the mechanism of ministry (the program event) and the ultimate effect (if there is one), without seeing the mysterious but vital connection between them -- the release of spirit and life.  This release of life and spirit is the defining point of ministry.</p>\n<p>True ministry begins and ends in the realm of the spirit.  Jesus said the spiritual man was like the wind.  You can see the effect of his deeds, but you cannot touch the source of it\'s power or direction(John 3:8).  The blowing wind shakes the leaves, and you can see the leaves move and hear their sound, but you cannot see the wind.  You can imitate ministry by manually shaking the tree, but the two are not the same.  Because you manage to shake the tree does not mean you are the wind.  Two men can speak the exact same words without having the same degree of effect.  The soldiers spoke concerning Jesus saying they \'never had heard a man who spoke like Him\'.  The disciples on the road to Emmaus said \'Did not His words burn in our heart\'?  This effect was not on account of the content of His message, though that was certainly important.  Nor was it the result of a passionate delivery.  Rather, it was the substance of spirit and life in His words.</p>\n<h4>Spiritual Words</h4>\n<p>Jesus understood God\'s intent to build the kingdom through spiritual means.  For this reason he used terms which were \'spiritual\' in his teaching; terms which may have been a little metaphysical to the natural man.  Nevertheless, His purpose was concrete and practical to the end.  While He may have seemed vague or \'spooky\', He was really dealing in a reality which is beyond the natural, but more real than anything of this earth.  If we are to follow his example, can we do it without his frame of reference?  Can we build what is spiritual, while being naturally minded?  Evidently Paul did not think so, as he made use of a similar style of speaking, and had the same view of the natural man.  Consider the following.</p>\n<p>\'These things we also speak, not in words which man\'s wisdom teaches but which the Holy Spirit teaches, comparing spiritual things with spiritual.  But the natural man does not receive the things of the Spirit of God, for they are foolishness to him; nor can he know them because they are spiritually discerned.\' (1 Cor. 2:13-14)</p>\n<p>Like Jesus, Paul\'s intent was not to be purposefully ambiguous or esoteric.  He was pragmatist of sorts. He loved to see the effect of the Kingdom on people.  But his practical nature did not require him to use earthly means to build what is inherently spiritual.  Nor would he allow mere \'Christian activity\' to masquerade as \'ministry\'.  He wanted the Corinthians to know that simply doing \'church\' things, did not make them spiritual.  The Corinthians were feverishly busy with what seemed to be spiritual activities, but they were not moving from the mind of Christ.  They were carnal (natural) and earthly minded.  Paul made this clear in chapter 3 when he told them they behaved \'as mere men\'.  He said, \'we have the mind of Christ, but I cannot speak to you as to spiritual men, but as to babes.\'  They had adopted a behavior consistent with ministry without having the proper understanding.</p>\n<p>The natural minded person is inclined to think \'Christian\' activities are automatically spiritual in nature.  \'Because I teach \'Sunday School\' I am doing ministry!  Because I am speaking to people about God, I am doing ministry!  Because I am giving to the poor I am doing ministry.\'  These are all well and good but may or may not qualify as ministry.  Ministry is not defined by what the deed is, but by what is produced in the spirit.  Has the Kingdom of God come and has it increased?</p>\n<h4>Faith</h4>\n<p>Since true ministry is spiritual faith becomes paramount.  We walk by faith and not by sight, remember!  The eye of faith sees the spirit realm allowing us to interact with it.  When sharing the Word or doing something for God, the eye of faith sees which things are truly spiritual, as opposed to what is simply Biblical.  The spiritual word is a word in \'due season\'.  One which is anointed by the Holy Spirit.  We can toil away our time, quoting scripture and making biblically sound statements, without speaking a spiritual word.  Jesus on the other hand said, \'The words that I speak to you are spirit and they are life.\'(John 6:63) <br />Ministry does not have to be dramatic, or particularly public.  Recently a friend of mine was travelling with a youth pastor.  The Spirit witnessed that He had something for the young man, but did not reveal what it was.  As he sat silently he meditated on what it could possibly be.  He thought about various scripture he had recently studied, but nothing moved his spirit.  About half way home a truth concerning leadership in the home bubbled up from his spirit.  As they shared together, there was a sense of that familiar breath of the Holy Spirit in the words.  Something of what was shared touched the youth pastor\'s spirit.  He testified to that fact.  This simple activity brought increase to the Kingdom of God as spirit and life were released from one person to another.  This is true ministry!  It is simple, yet the basis of a kingdom which cannot pass away.  For this reason we must be spirit led in our use of words.  Peter exhorted us this way.</p>\n<p>\'If anyone speaks, let him speak as the oracles of God.  If anyone ministers, let him do it as with the ability which God supplies, that in all things God may be glorified through Jesus Christ, to who belong the glory and the dominion forever and ever. Amen.\' (1 Peter 4:11)</p>\n<p>The \'oracles of God\' is just another way of saying the \'Word of God\'.  In essence Peter was saying, \'if you stand to minister the Word of God, let it be spirit and life.  Speak in the power of Christ as though Jesus himself were speaking in your place or do not speak at all.\'  This is indeed a high calling, but it is the difference between building what is natural and building what is spiritual.  It is not sufficient to do what looks like ministry.  To minister with the power which God supplies and to speak as the oracles of God means to do something which has it\'s primary effect in the spirit realm.  Why?  Because God is building something which is spirit as He is.  The Lord is building a spiritual house.  Only what is spirit and life adds to the labors of God and can qualify as ministry.  Everything else is flesh and Jesus said the flesh profits nothing.</p>\n<h4>The Building</h4>\n<p>As any man would build a house for himself, God is also building, but without brick and mortar.  In this way His building is technologically far superior.  In fact, it is so superior that the plan itself is a mystery.  God is building a building not made with hands, eternal in the heavens.  It is spiritual and therefore immaterial.  This is what makes it a mystery to the natural man.  This also makes it impossible for the natural man to help build it.</p>\n<p>In the same way you cannot build a brick house out of wood, you cannot build a spiritual house with flesh.  The spiritual man knows the things of the spirit.  He has seen past the natural and by virtue of revelation, can discern the Lord\'s spiritual building.  As we grow in spiritual maturity our capacity to appreciate the Lord\'s work increases.  Our faith increases and we are able to substitute natural works for spiritual ones.  In this process, what was formerly \'ghost like\' and difficult to understand becomes clear.  Paul saw these things by revelation and made reference to them in Ephesians.</p>\n<p>\'Now, therefore, you are no longer strangers and foreigners, but fellow citizens with the saints and members of the household of God, having been built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ Himself being the chief cornerstone, in whom the whole building, being fitted together, grows into a holy temple in the Lord, in whom you also are being built together for a dwelling place of God in the Spirit.\' (Ephesians 2:19-22)</p>\n<p>This is the mystery of God.  People who were once divorced from God, castaways of His presence,are now to be His temple.  It seems a fantastic thing that people would be the only material the Lord would use in His house.  To be able to minister alongside of God\'s program it is imperative that we understand the blueprint.  If our vision is not a spiritual kingdom and if we cannot yet discern the release of spirit and life, how can we contribute what is spiritual?  While it is very easy to go through motions which mirror Biblical activity, it is quite another to add to the Kingdom of God in the spirit.  Instead of seeing the spiritual nature of the kingdom we have embraced \'Christian activity\'.</p>\n<p>Peter had a similar perspective on the nature of ministry, and he uses some of the same terminology.  In fact, you will find him giving the same precautions concerning the issue of building the Kingdom. (1 Peter 4:11, 1 Cor 3:9-10)  He wrote the warning after declaring the people to be a \'spiritual house\', each member being a \'living stone\'.  <br />\'...you also, as living stones, are being built up a spiritual house, a holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God through Jesus Christ.\' (1 Peter 2:5)</p>\n<p>This is not an abstract meaningless collection of words.  It is perhaps one of the most important statements concerning the Christian purpose.  It cuts though the maze of Christian activities by defining the Lord\'s purpose in ministry.  Mainly, we are being built as a \'spiritual house\' unto the Lord.  What is a house for?  To dwell in of course!  It is the Lord\'s purpose to live in us both as individual\'s and as a corporate expression of Himself.  He is Emmanuel, \'God with us\'.  His longing is to see us united as one cohesive force in the spirit and that His presence should dwell in this house.  It goes a step further calling each member of the Church a \'living stone\'.  This tells us we cannot overlook the value of imparting life to one believer.  It should also reveal the serious way God views us as the corporate and individual temples.  A serious view which did not escape Paul.</p>\n<p>\'Do you not know that you are the temple of God and that the Spirit of God dwells in you?  If anyone defiles the temple of God, God will destroy him. For the temple of God is holy, which temple you are.\' (1 Corinthians 3:16-17)</p>\n<p>This warning was not issued to people whose minds were set on defiling the Body.  It was given to those who viewed church ministry in a carnal way.  People who made it their business to learn as much about \'church life\' and \'ministry systems\' as possible in order to advance or make their mark on the world.  People who look for a sense of belonging and importance by doing \'Christian\' things.  It was not necessarily the actions which disqualified them, but the carnal motives in what was otherwise \'church activity\'.  To these Paul wanted to make it expressly clear that the people were corporately and individually the temple of God.  The temple must not be tampered with, but established and built in the fear of God.  In keeping with this admonition he also said:</p>\n<p>\'...you are God\'s building.  According to the grace of God which was given to me, as a wise master builder I have laid the foundation, and another builds on it.  But let each one take heed how he builds on it.\' (1 Corinthians 3:9b-10)</p>\n<p>How one builds is crucial!  Two men may appear as athletic muscular sprinters.  If one has achieved his power through the use of steroids, he has built incorrectly.  When the time of testing comes he will be disqualified from his reward.  We should build the temple God\'s way.  God is spirit; the building is spirit; nothing but what is of the spirit can contribute.  Everything else is meaningless wood, hay and stubble.  We may be an impressive preacher with a passionate convincing delivery, but if we do not release the spirit and life of Jesus, we have done nothing.  We can diligently witness to every person we see, but if we have not learned to release the spirit and life, the kingdom of God remains unchanged.  We may sacrifice every comfort for the cause of a church program, but if that program does not effect something fundamentally spirit in nature, our effort is in vain.</p>\n<h4>Conclusion</h4>\n<p>It is clear the apostles understood the Church as the habitation of God-- the temple.  This fact seems to escape the notice of the contemporary Church.  We have made the numbers of people in our congregation our first priority.  The size of our buildings, our mailing list, and the value of our car has become first place.  In many ways we have followed the wind, the earthquake and the fire.  The invisible nature of true ministry is hidden from our eyes, but remains the Lord\'s chief priority.  Since it is \'Him to whom we must give account\' we should exercise as much caution as Paul did in his ministry.</p>\n<p>At this time you may be enjoying this article and feeling like you are a spiritual person.  On the other hand you might be questioning the value of all you are currently doing.  Then again, you may be entirely confused.  The point of this article is not to define what should and should not be done.  My purpose is only to create in you a desire to walk in the spirit.  By highlighting the spiritual aspect of the kingdom of God I believe a cry will arise from your heart to the Lord saying, \'Lord show me your Kingdom\'.  When we feel like we are on the cutting edge we will not press on, but become complacent.  When trying to build for the Lord, it is vital that we guard against being \'self-satisfied\'.  Men are especially prone to congratulate themselves when trying to do some good.  While God does indeed love us dearly, He is not so easily impressed.  His program will not be sacrificed for the sake of our ego\'s.  It is simply not sufficient to be doing Christian things. It is time for us to seriously take account of the Lord\'s opinion of our works.  For the kingdom of God is not in word, but in power. (1 Cor. 4:20)</p>'),(14,'The Principle of Life','<p />The primary reason Jesus came was to give LIFE.  His gift to the world was not a new religion or a fresh moral code; it was and still is LIFE.  The Apostle John puts it this way: \'This is the record, that God has given to us eternal LIFE, and this LIFE is in His Son.\' (1 John 5:11)  What does this mean to the believer?  It means being a believer is much more than doing Christian and Church related activities.  Jesus meant for our\n\nlife to consist of what His LIFE produces in us.  We are to experience and give away this LIFE.  Before we can do that we must come to distinguish what it is and what it is not!</p>\n<h4>The Sentence of Death</h4>\n<p>When the Lord sent Jesus to the earth it was to save mankind and redeem the whole of creation from the principle of death.  Since the fall of man all of creation has become subject to death.  This is evident at every turn.  For example, a new house is subject to deterioration, no matter how well it is built.  Your new car will turn to dust if given enough time; and your beautiful garden will become overrun with weeds if not properly kept.  On top of this, the process of aging suggests our bodies are continually subject to death.  Each of these are the effects of the curse of sin and death.  As such, the creation is desperately in need of redemption.  As it is written: <br />\'For the creation was subjected to futility, not of its own will, but because of Him who subjected it, in hope that the creation itself also will be set free from its slavery to corruption into the freedom of the glory of the children of God. For we know that the whole creation groans and suffers the pains of childbirth together until now.\' <br />(Romans 8:20-22)</p>\n<p>Concerning our bodies Paul writes: <br />\'Therefore we do not lose heart. Even though our outward man is perishing,..\' <br />(2 Corinthians 4:16)</p>\n<p>Our bodies along with everything else in creation are on a downward slope directed towards annihilation.  This is the outcome of the spiritual disease we call death!  When Adam and Eve were placed in the garden of Eden they were told not to eat of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.  The penalty was that they would die.  At the precise moment they disobeyed God death entered the creation.  Though things did not immediately die, the principle of death became entrenched within the fabric of the universe.  The fate of all living things was now sealed, their end would be unavoidable death.</p>\n<h4>Incarnate Life</h4>\n<p>Happily Jesus came!  He came as One offering life and redemption.  In fact, not only does He offer LIFE, but He Himself is LIFE.  Notice what the Apostle John writes! <br />\'That which was from the beginning, which we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes, which we have looked upon, and our hands have handled, of the Word of LIFE; For the LIFE was manifested, and we have seen it, and bear witness, and show unto you that eternal LIFE, which was with the Father, and was manifested to us:\' <br />(1 John 1:1-2)</p>\n<p>And again, <br />\'In Him was LIFE; and the LIFE was the light of men.\' <br />(John 1:4)</p>\n<p>Notice!  Jesus not only came to give us LIFE; He is that LIFE.  Without Jesus there is only one inevitable common end to all living things.  Death!  All who wish to live may do so through Jesus Christ.  There is no other way.  Some unbelievers consider Christianity to be arrogant and intolerant because of this fact.  An accusation which holds no ground in truth.  On the other hand, truth says \'All creation is under the sentence of death and HE alone is LIFE.  This is not arrogance, it is a simple statement of reality.  The preaching of the gospel which declares all men doomed to hell is not a condemnation, but a statement of mankinds actual condition.  A point which both Jesus and the Apostles make abundantly clear. <br />Jesus said: <br />\'I am the resurrection and the LIFE: he that believes in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live:\' <br />(John 11:25)</p>\n<p>and again, <br />\'I am the way, the truth and the LIFE: no man comes to the Father, but by me.\' <br />(John 14:6)</p>\n<p>Likewise the Apostle John wrote: <br />\'He that has the Son has LIFE; and he that does not have the Son of God does not have LIFE.\' <br />(1 John 5:12)</p>\n<p>Jesus is LIFE, all that is outside of Him has no LIFE.  This makes the judgment of God a very straightforward matter.  In that day He will simply divide between LIFE and death.  Whatever is alive will remain, while everything without LIFE will be condemned, and indeed is already condemned. (John 3:19)  So then LIFE begins and ends with Jesus.  However, there is more! Not only are we made alive by Him, but He becomes the source of our living energy.</p>\n<h4>The Word as Seed</h4>\n<p>The best way to understand the power of LIFE is by considering one of the Lord\'s own parables: The Parable of the Sower.  The picture is simple enough.  A man sows seed onto the ground.  The seed falls in both good and poor ground.  When that seed finds some good ground it produces good fruit.  In His explanation Jesus said the seed is the Word of God.  The seed that is sown is the nature and power of God as represented in Jesus since He is the Word of God.</p>\n<p>\'In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.\' <br />(John 1:1)</p>\n<p>This means that these three are interchangeable: LIFE, the Word of God, and Jesus.  When a man receives the Word of God in his heart and becomes born-again, He is receiving Jesus and His LIFE.  Thus, He is saved by LIFE entering where before there was only death.  But LIFE does not enter as a stagnant commodity, it is a seed designed to produce according to its genetic nature.</p>\n<p>\'... having been born again, not of corruptible seed but incorruptible, through the word of God which lives and abides forever.\' <br />(1 Peter 1:23)</p>\n<p>The fascinating part of the seed is its inherent power to produce according to its own composition.  When you plant a carrot seed it produces carrots, while radish seeds will create a crop of radishes.  This principle is displayed from the very beginning of creation (Genesis 1:11).  It is a part of the inherent nature of LIFE and represents a profound truth.  That is, when we are born-again and receive the seed of God in our spirit, it has the power to form in us the nature of Jesus.  Since it is a spiritual force, nothing we do outside of believing can add to its effectiveness.  We are only called to receive the Word by believing it.  We cannot be born-again by the will of man neither can we increase by it.</p>\n<p>\'But as many as received Him, to them He gave the right to become children of God, to those who believe in His name: who were born not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God.\' <br />(John 1:12-13)</p>\n<p>Paul declared that we have only to sow the seed and water it.  From that point forward the increase comes by the LIFE of God.  As often quoted, \'Not by might, nor by power, but by My Spirit says the Lord\'.  <br />The burden most believers fall under is the impossible task of being \'Holy as He is Holy!\' (1 Peter 1:15)  This is certainly a high calling and quite impossible by the will of the flesh or the will of man.  But this of course was how the Lord intented it.  He did not wish or permit that men could succeed.  Rather, He would place His Life and nature in the womb of our spirit and supplant the life of our flesh.  The outcome would be the LIFE and nature of the very Jesus we worship.</p>\n<p>\'...as His divine power has given to us all things that pertain to life and godliness,...\' <br />(2 Peter 1:3)</p>\n<p>Our interpretation of what He wishes usually requires all our strength and commitment.  It ceases to be the workmanship of Christ and becomes our effort to tailor our flesh into compliance.  This does not produce actual Christlikeness but a cheap imitation.  It results in a shallow caricature of Jesus, with only a vague likeness and no power.  It is something more like a silhouhette or a shadow than the real thing.  We may be impressed by our work but the world will never buy it.</p>\n<p>The real key to Christianity is found in Faith and Patience.  As found in Hebrews 6:12, which says \'That ye be not slothful, but followers of them who through faith and patience inherit the promises.\'  Faith because we must believe in the working of His power within us.  Patience because we must wait on growth.  No farmer can ever have a successul crop if he keeps digging up the ground to see if anything is growing.  This will do nothing but stagnate the developing seed.</p>\n<h4>Application</h4>\n<p>What then can we do?  First and foremost we must apply our hearts to grasp this truth.  From a practical viewpoint several things are important.  For one we must be sure to water the seed and to continue sowing both for ourselves and others.  We should make it a point to be regularly seeking the Lord and His Word.  On top of this we should keep our ground clean.  As with the parable of the sower there are things which impede the growth of LIFE within us.  Choosing to suppress the dictates of our flesh is a good start.  However, it should be understood that this is not righteousness in itself.  It only gives place for the nature of Jesus to have its expression in our lives.  Change will not come by our strength or resourcefulness, it comes fromthe increase of LIFE within us.  As Paul declared, \'I am crucified with Christ, it is no longer I who live, but Christ lives in me: and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and delivered Himself up for me.\'(Galatians 2:20)</p>'),(15,'The Preeminence of Christ','<p />The plan of God will have run it\'s course when Jesus has the preeminence in all things.  Meaning, it is God\'s design that Jesus be first.  However, there is a battle for preeminence now being waged. It began when Lucifer rebelled.  He coveted a position of preeminent rank and has lured man into the same covetousness.  Though not always visible, the warfare rages continually in the heart of every man, woman and child.  It is the focal point where two kingdoms clash.  When each of us stand before the Lord this twofold pivotal\n\nquestion will be asked.  \'What place did you give to Jesus, and how does it measure against the place you gave yourself?\'</p>\n<h4>The Preeminent One</h4>\n<p>There is a powerful piece of scripture in Colossians which concludes with the following phrases. <br />\'And He is before all things, and in Him all things consist.  And He is the head of the body, the church, who is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead, that in all things He may have the preeminence.\' <br />(Colossians 1:17-18)</p>\n<p>This rather lofty declaration is just the conclusion of the scriptures most powerful endorsement of Christ.  The language is pointed and seems to build as you read through it. At the apex is this portion: \'...that in all things He may have the preeminence.\' C learly, it is central in God\'s purpose to see Jesus recognized as the \'preeminent\' figure within creation.  To be preeminent means that you are \'outstanding; having paramount rank, dignity, or importance\'.  This suggests that God has so designed the universe as to give Jesus the premier position.  He is the hub, the centre around which all things revolve; the point of reference for all comparisons and measures.  Therefore, it is the Father\'s design to see all of creation recognize and honor Him as such.  Everything not responsive to this order stands in competition.  The Kingdom rule of Christ will come to fullness when all His competitors are either destroyed or brought into line.</p>\n<h4>The Competitors</h4>\n<p>But who are His competitors?  In short, anyone infected or moved by covetousness is in some way competing with Christ.  Covetousness is the love of money; the love of advantage and power.  Money is the most concrete form of power. It gives us the ability to exalt ourselves over others.  When we love money, it is because we love to have a position of advantage over others.  Covetousness incites man to use everything in his possession to gain the upper hand.  If there is an upper hand, it is His right to give, and not ours to take.  He alone deserves the place of preeminence and advantage.  Anyone else pursuing this place is supplanting Christ\'s right to be preeminent in all things.  Such a one is the competitor of Christ.  It was for this reason Jesus warned us that a man cannot serve God and Mammon.</p>\n<p>In our society, covetousness is not only tolerated, it is actively encouraged.  We find it only too natural to want more.  A recent advertising blitz made light of the fact that \'we want it all\'.  Whereas Paul promoted the value of contentment, man continues to trumpet his right to have it all.  In this way we have glorified ambition(desire for preeminence).  We say that one is motivated, as he feverishly claws his way up the ladder of power, wealth and fame.  We might call him a \'self-starter\'.  We tolerate and encourage ambition in the right circumstances.  That is until it passes that undefinable point where it becomes unappealing.  But were we to look at covetousness with the eyes of Christ, we would surely give it no place of tolerance.  In order to see it that way we must go to the beginning--to the root.  This will enable us to see covetousness as the poison it really is; the love of money and the root of all evil. </p>\n<h4>Covetousness</h4>\n<p>Covetousness began with Lucifer.  He coveted.  And now the power of rebellion is being driven by the same covetousness.  But what is covetousness?  It is a fancy word for \'desire\'.  Amazing is it not?  The simple and common activity of \'wanting\', is at the root of all of this world\'s evil.  It may surprise many of us to know that the need to possess is the power behind all rebellion.  Think of the implications!  All of the earth\'s misery, crime and evil sprouts from the singular objective: I want!  James writes to the Church saying that all conflict arises from the desire to obtain and control.</p>\n<p>\'Where do wars and fights come from among you?  Do they not come from your desires for pleasure that war in your members?  You lust (desire) and do not have.  You murder and covet and cannot obtain.  You fight and war.\' <br />(James 4:1-2a)</p>\n<p>This rather stern piece of scripture is written to believers.  It is a harsh warning against walking in the spirit of covetousness.  James goes on to equate it as friendship with the world, saying that it will make us the enemy of God.  He understood the danger and wrote for our example and instruction.  It would be a tragic mistake to overlook this area of teaching.  Covetousness is the root and seed of the Kingdom of Darkness.  If it is tolerated in our lives, it will bring forth the identical fruit presently at work throughout the earth. <br />That fruit is evident in every ethnic, religious and political conflict in today\'s news.  Every atrocity committed by man begins with the same basic desire we might have for a house, or a car.  Oh, we could easily argue that there is nothing wrong with wanting a better life. Or is there?  Please do not misinterpret the message.  God is not against giving us things.  Things are not the problem.  Wanting is the problem.  If we indulge that yearning, we will someday realize it can never be satisfied.  Instead enjoying what we have been given we \'must have\' what is not ours.  As the saying goes: \'The grass is always greener on the other side\', therefore hell continues to widen.</p>\n<p>\'Therefore hell has enlarged herself, and opened her mouth without measure: and their glory, and their multitude, and their pomp, and he that rejoices, shall descend into it.\' <br />(Isaiah 5:14)</p>\n<p>\'Hell and destruction are never full; so the eyes of man are never satisfied.\' <br />(Proverbs 27:20)</p>\n<p>The covetous man can never rest.  His ambition will never satisfy him; and so he continues to pursue higher levels of indulgence.  Herein is the secret of its evil.  It will not stop until it possesses all things.  We excuse covetousness in our lives because what we want seems so insignificant.  We can easily reason and justify our desires by asking, \'Why wouldn\'t God want me to have this?\'  Again, that is not the point.  The Lord is happy to bless us.  But there are two paths to receiving.  One is a pathway of faith; the other uses human strength and ambition.  With faith there is contentment and peace; through striving there is nothing but anxiety, frustration and a growing list of \'wants\'.  The scripture says that where there is ambition and strife, there is confusion and every evil thing.  Covetousness is the doorway to the most vile and inhuman forms of darkness.  The smallest amount of covetousness, if not overcome, will give life to the most dreadful forms of evil.</p>\n<p>Since desire can never be satisfied there is no end of the line.  If we were to somehow realize every want, we would one day stand before the living Christ and openly contend for His throne.  The average person scoffs at the bloodthirsty power of monarchs and dictators of history who longed for world domination.  We think this way only because world domination is not next on our list.  Do not be deceived!  Covetousness respects nothing and will always seek to possess what lies immediately out of reach.  No matter what it is!  We foolishly believe that achieving our present ambitions would satisfy us.  Make no mistake about it, if we are not content now, we never will be.  And if we have coveted another man\'s possessions, we have coveted the throne of Christ.</p>\n<h4>The Principle</h4>\n<p>There is a principle we must grasp.  It says: Every seed produces after it\'s own kind.  Covetousness, desire and ambition--or whatever we wish to call it-- will lead us into Lucifer\'s rebellion.  We can see this through the following passages: \'For where selfish ambition and strife is, there is confusion and every evil thing.\' (James 3:16)  And again, \'But I say unto you, That whosoever looks on a woman to lust after her has committed adultery with her already in his heart.\' (Matthew 5:28).  And once more, \'For rebellion is as the sin of witchcraft, and stubbornness is as iniquity and idolatry.\' (1 Samuel 15:23)  Once the seed planted and given time to mature it will grow from simple rebellion to witchcraft.</p>\n<p>What we are saying is this: If covetousness is not overcome in it\'s simplest seed like form, it will yield more complex and greater desires.  The seed can be in anything we desire.  The mature fruit of all coveting is expressed by Lucifer\'s arrogance.</p>\n<p>\'How you have fallen from heaven, O Lucifer, son of the morning!  How you are cut down to the ground, which did weaken the nations!  For you have said in your heart, I will ascend into heaven, I will exalt my throne above the stars of God: I will sit also upon the mount of the congregation, in the sides of the north: I will ascend above the heights of the clouds; I will be like the most High.\' <br />(Isaiah 14:12-14)</p>\n<p>For most of us it is difficult to see ourselves coming to this point.  We overestimate our goodness.  Lucifer was created far more powerful; he was far more glorious, and he saw far more of God\'s glory than we, yet covetousness brought him to this point.  It is not something to be toyed with.  Rather, we should pursue the example of David.</p>\n<h4>The Heart of David</h4>\n<p>Contrasting the drive for preeminence is the humble heart of David. His example is particularly inspiring considering his potential for self indulgence. As the king of Israel it was only human that he would consider himself worthy of various special privileges. As the king he deserved respect and that his subjects would be inspired by his composure and dignity. Yet, David displayed an uncommon awareness of the Lord\'s right to preeminence. This was powerfully displayed in the spectacle he made while bringing the ark up to it\'s resting place. With all his heart he danced before the Lord. Disrobed of his kingly vestures he made it known to all Israel that though he served as king in their midst there really was just one King. His wife was deeply offended by his lack of dignity. To which he responded: <br />\'It was before the Lord, who chose me instead of your father and all his house, to appoint me ruler over the people of the Lord, over Israel. Therefore I will play music before the Lord. <br />And I will be even more undignified than this, and will be humble in my own sight.\' <br />(2 Samuel 6:21-22a)</p>\n<p>Despite his position within the Kingdom of Israel and the plan of God David never lost sight of the Lord of Majesty. While others may use their place of position for self exaltation, he refused. It is this heart which the Lord seeks to instil in all of us. Unfortunately, the more God uses us in his plan the more our hearts will tend to depart from this example.  The challenge to our hearts becomes especially difficult when we are appointed to represent the Lord in a position of spiritual authority.  For this reason those in leadership must be especially careful not to use our appointed function to gain preeminence.</p>\n<p>The downfall of the Pharisee\'s surrounded this very issue.  Though they \'sat in the seat of Moses\' they did not resist the temptation to covet God\'s glory.  Jesus highlighted their hypocrisy because they longed for the premier seats, and the titles which reflected honor.  Today the ministry wrestles with the same temptation.  It is common to justify coveting when the goal seems to be righteous.  In our misguided zeal to fulfil a sense of calling we covet position and platform.  But there is a difference between chasing position and being given it.  Paul spoke of a dispensation of grace being given to him. He did not covet it, or manipulate others to increase his profile politically.  He did not climb the ladder of ministry success.  He was faithful.  When a man is faithful, and his heart is set on pursuing God, there is a contentment with his current place and role.  In the Kingdom of God levels of influence are granted, they are never the result of competition.  Rather, we are to pursue faith demonstrated in faithfulness.</p>\n<h4>The Battlefield</h4>\n<p>At this time the whole of creation is a battlefield for preeminence.  The spirit of the age... in fact the spirit of man himself, is completely self-absorbed.  We are ruthlessly committed to seeking the upper hand--the preeminence.  The most natural tendency from the moment we are born is to seek for and hold a place of highest importance.  Children are taught that the \'word does not revolve around them\'.  Why?  Because the consider themselves the center of the universe.  There was a time when grown men thought the sun revolved around the earth.  In fact it was believed that the earth was the very centre of the universe.  This was certainly the outflow of man\'s need to be preeminent.  But whether the drive for preeminence is in the world or in Church, it will come to light and be judged.  The axe has been laid to the root, and soon the entire tree will wither and die.</p>\n<p>Covetousness is not only unappealing; it is antichrist at the very root.  It seeks to usurp the place of Christ.  If we are seeking the place of preeminence, we are seeking the place of Christ.  Man\'s ambition to sit in the seat of Christ --the Preeminent One-- is equal to Lucifer\'s quest for God\'s throne. (Isaiah 14)  It is natural then that in destroying Satan and his evil hordes the Lord would condemn all who have sided with his ambition.  Seeking the place of preeminence might be considered a simple problem of selfishness, but it is in reality the height of rebellion.  It is the quest to sit in the seat of God.  We live in a time when the distinction between light and darkness is becoming increasingly evident.  \'Therefore, since we are receiving a kingdom which cannot be shaken, let us have grace, by which we may serve God acceptably with reverence and godly fear.  For our God is a consuming fire.  And\'let your conduct be without covetousness; be content with such things as you have.\'  (Hebrews 12:28-29 &13:5a)</p>'),(16,'The Place of Signs','<p />The Church is poised to experience a dramatic release of signs and wonders.  The exact moment of that release is not exactly clear.  It is enough to know that it is coming and that it is desperately needed.  Without a sovereign outpouring of power the task of world evangelism will never be accomplished.  However, like most forms of power, \'divine power\' can be dangerous if not handled with mature wisdom.  Advance preparation should be a priority.  Historical outpourings of power, as well as the Lord\'s own\n\napproach to signs and wonders, can teach us a lot about the place and purpose of miraculous power.  A serious study of this issue would be helpful, if not vital.</p>\n<h4>Signs and Wonders</h4>\n<p>Just a little under fifty years ago two distinct, but almost parallel, outpourings of the Holy Spirit began.  One resulted in what is called the Latter Rain Movement while the other gave birth to a host of power evangelists moving in signs and wonders.  Anyone who has studied this era can attest to the tremendous benefits to countless individuals who received healing and salvation.  In addition, there were great strides in worldwide evangelism as thousands were released in fresh power to preach the gospel.  Unfortunately, no move of God comes without its problems.  As in this time period, the Chronicles of God\'s dealings with men will always highlight the shortcomings of mortal flesh.  Especially when mortal flesh has come into contact with immortal power.</p>\n<p>While the signs and wonders did much to validate the claims of Jesus Christ they became a distraction to many.  This is not to say there is anything inherently wrong with signs and wonders. The real problem is with men.  We are prone to natural thinking and have a poor capacity for seeing the things which really coitunt.  To avoid similar problems we should prepare our attitude and response to supernatural phenomenon before it unfolds.  Like any decent military commander, we should know at least the basics of the battle plan before we set out to war. ie. What are our key objectives?  Knowing the purpose of signs and wonders is fundamental in this aim.  Having a clear understanding of the function of supernatural manifestations will keep us focused during the \'hurried pace\' of battle.</p>\n<h4>Fascination Fixation</h4>\n<p>Man\'s key problem with the supernatural surrounds his fascination with the fantastic.  We like extreme displays of power; things that leave both ourselves and others in awe.  This makes it possible for signs and wonders to become an end in themselves.  Manifestations of power want occupy our attention since they are visible and unusual.  This is at least a part of the downfall of the Church during the 50\'s and 60\'s.  The best way to avoid this pitfall is through spiritual maturity.  The truly mature believer can appreciate phenomenon without it becoming a distraction.  He can do this because understands that \'everything which exists in the natural realm is secondary in the purpose of God.\'  Paul says:</p>\n<p>\'Therefore we do not lose heart. Even though our outward man is perishing, yet the inward man is being renewed day by day.\' (2 Corinthians 4:16)</p>\n<p>All that is physical has to do with the outward man.  God on the other hand is concerned with the inward man.  Signs and wonders are also outward in one sense.  They can arrest our attention, but as we can see with the Pharicee\'s, they will not change a man\'s heart.  When the attention of the  Christian community becomes the production and display of signs, we can sure men\'s hearts have stopped being changed.  If we are to succeed in widespread power evangelism, we must overcome immature preoccupations and see the Kingdom within as the Lord sees it.  As the Lord said, \'The Kingdom is within you\'.</p>\n<h4>The Life Principle</h4>\n<p>When the life of Jesus is active within a believer, his outer life will change.  This is evidence that the Kingdom of God is increasing.  He will display greater grace in his attitudes and actions.  Self-control, patience and other fruit of the spirit will surface and flourish.  This is the essence of Christianity: Jesus working from the inside out.  When the spirit of man is living face to face with Jesus, good things will appear in his natural life.  It is at this very junction where we can begin to neglect the life giving flow of Christ\'s power.  In our enthusiasm for visible evidence of God we can be deceived.</p>\n<p>Picture a seed buried in the ground having just germinated.  The shell of the seed has cracked and the beginning of life\'s tremendous presence emerges.  The young whitish sprout gradually coils out, guided by the impulses of an unseen force.  It lurches out of the ground beginning the first phase of visible development in what will soon be a beautiful flower.  While we can gaze in appreciation at the developing flower, we must focus on the source of its growth hidden underground.  If we forget to nourish and water the plant it will die and shrivel up.  This is the essences of what happens to revivals.  When we are distracted by what we see, we can begin to neglect what we cannot see -- the root; the unseen source of all that is good.  Thus we are exhorted to keep the right focus:</p>\n<p>\'While we do not look at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen. For the things which are seen are temporary, but the things which are not seen are eternal.\' (2 Corinthians 4:18)</p>\n<p>The things which are seen are appealing to the natural mind.  The things which are not seen are what really counts.  At the core of the believer he is joined in one spirit with the Lord.  When we give expression to that union through intimacy and fellowship with Jesus, life is released.  Bringing people to this vital union is the foremost goal of all preaching and teaching.  Face to face, spirit to spirit fellowship, is the key to the Christian experience.  Thus, the root of all righteousness comes from the spirit.</p>\n<p>Signs and wonders are the result of a body of people flowing together in the heart of God.  Phenomenon is the result and not the purpose of our service to God.  When signs and wonders displace intimacy in the spirit of man, they have outlived their purpose.  Intimacy is the fountain head of miraculous power.  When you lose the fountain head you lose the whole fountain.  If you kill the root, you kill the flower.  The Lord gives signs and wonders only to lead men to Himself.  When they become a vehicle for glorifying men, the Lord will withdraw them or remove the man.  This has been the pattern of all past revivals.</p>\n<h4>Focusing on the Invisible</h4>\n<p>Like most other men the disciples were inclined to be earthly (carnal) in their viewpoint.  When they were released to move in power they saw amazing things.  Returning to the Lord, they were jubilant, reciting testimonies of anointing and authority with great pomp.  At this point the Lord gives them a stern warning.  He said: \'rejoice not, that the spirits are subject to you; but rather rejoice, because your names are written in heaven.\' (Luke 10:20)  While I do not think the Lord was displeased with their joy, He saw a danger in their fixation.  Proper focus is the key here.  The Lord wanted them to set their eyes on the invisible.  His direction was that they should focus on fact that their names were written in the Book of Life.  We cannot see our names written; we can, however, see when demons come out with authority.  Any focus on \'things visible\', even when it comes from the Lord, can be the very things which lead us away from Christ.  In addition, this focus keeps the matter of grace forefront in our minds.  As you might imagine this has implications for the subject matter of our preaching and teaching. </p>\n<p>While studying this era I couldn\'t help but notice the volumes and volumes of material devoted to the careful scrutiny of manifestations.  Countless books, articles and tapes were released explaining the dynamics of healing and other miracles.  It seemed every conceivable effort was being made to produce more and more.  Most of the attention was being paid to the manifestation and not the source.  The question I am proposing is this: \'Before this rash of spontaneous grace appeared in the Church was there an abundance of focus on these themes?\'  Or in other words,  \'Did the attention to phenomenon usher in signs and wonders or come after they became abundant?\'  It seems that it was during, and toward the end of this revival, that this occurred.  It almost looks like the focus on signs and wonders increased as the manifestations decreased.  It was as though much of the teaching and preaching became a vain effort to hold on to what was fading.  I may be overstating my point but please hear my heart.</p>\n<p>Signs and wonders are the by-product of abiding in the Lord.  They are a culmination of the Lord\'s discipline and training in our hearts.  In as much as a Father would never give a loaded gun to a three year old, the Lord only releases His Church when it is ready to faithfully manage the responsibility.  On top of that, the continuation of power hinges on focused abiding in the Lord.  When it becomes our aim to have a lot of healing and miracles, we will have already begun to sabotage their existence.  Maybe the following illustration can help solidify my meaning.</p>\n<p>Imagine if you can a beautiful fountain of water shooting up into the air.  This spectacle will remain so long as the pump remains in working order.  The pump is the true source of power.  The fountain is responsible for nothing in itself.  Understanding the path of the water will never help us create a fountain! Knowing the water trajectory, or at what angles it strikes the pond will not help us maintain a continuous spout! It is merely the product of the proper function of the pumping mechanism.  Even so, few people would approach a fountain asking, \'Where is the pump?\' Or, \'how does the pump work?\'  Likewise the carnal man is attracted to signs and wonders.  He will be simply inclined to enjoy the view.  On the other hand the mature believer should be less concerned with the fountain and more concerned with the pump.  The miraculous flow of power in the Church is due to its connection to the source of life and power.  When that connection is neglected, the fountain will disappear.</p>\n<p>We need to realize that when signs and wonders appear many will marvel.  Thousands of people will be drawn to see and hear what is happening.  There will be great temptation on men to use the power for selfish purposes.  In addition, young believers will naturally be over enthusiastic about the supernatural authority accompanying this kind of anointing.  Maturity at this point will be essential to stabilize the revival.  Men and women who can see past the fountain to the pump will be essential to the Church.  In keeping with that need it is important we understand Christ\'s own approach to miracles.</p>\n<p>Few ministries, if any, had as many miracles as His.  Yet, not much of His teaching revolved around phenomenon.  There are no expositions on the dynamics of miracles; there are no five point messages on moving in miracle power.  In fact nowhere are people encouraged by Jesus to seek to increase the miraculous.  Rather, there is a continuous orientation around the person of Jesus and obedience to the Father.  When the disciples specifically asked how to do miracles, Jesus responded saying, \'Jesus answered and said to them, This is the work of God, that you believe on him whom he has sent.\' (John 6:29)  We need not seek to increase the anointing, just increase in knowing Christ -- the \'Anointed One\'.  Remember, \'the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy\'(Rev. 19:10).  The Holy Spirit is given to reveal Christ.  As such, the ministry of Jesus continually focused on the principles of humility, repentance and simple faith.  When we find ourselves in the midst of great power, should it be any different?</p>\n<p>In the book of Acts we find tremendous testimonies of the moving of the Holy Spirit in power.  Even so, the objective of the believing community was obedience to the heart of God.  Philip had obviously worked this point through in his own heart.  When the Lord asked him to leave the environment of the miraculous outpouring he did so without hesitation(Acts 8:26).  In so doing, he became the first link to the continent of Africa.  As a bonus, he was physically translated by the Spirit to another geographical location.  If he had not understood what was of primary importance, he might have argued for the opportunity to stay where \'God was really moving\'.  Thank the Lord for humble hearts.</p>\n<h4>Another Paradox</h4>\n<p>Nevertheless, we are clearly instructed to desire spiritual gifts.  We should thirst for the supernatural of God, and yearn to see the operations of the Holy Spirit.  And yet not abuse it, or allow it to be a substitute for Jesus.  The balance of these two tensions can be stated like this: \'Signs and wonders will be the by-product of life in the spirit; not the goal of life in the spirit.\'  There is coming a wave of power such as the Church has never seen.  This release will be due to many factors.  Significant among them is the need to please His heart in simple obedience.  We must learn to focus on Him and His desire.  This is an essential component of spiritual maturity.  When the Lord sees fit to release His signs and wonders they must never take the preeminence.  In all things Jesus must have the preeminence.  Since this is much easier to say than to do, especially in the wake of power, we should pray that we might have grace in that time.</p>'),(17,'The Mountain of the Lord','<p />In the face of extreme opposition the Lord is calling for His Church to hold fast to His promise. Faith has become the focal point of this present struggle as the winds of doubt and confusion seek to crush our present hope. And what is that hope? Mainly the promise of Isaiah 2 which declares, ?And it shall come to pass in the last days, that the mountain of the Lord?s house shall be established in the top of the mountains, and shall be exalted above the hills; and all nations shall flow unto it.?. (vs 2) This is the promise of the\n\nultimate victory of light over darkness. But like all the promises it must be mixed with faith in order to be realized. Therefore we are in a fight to see the promises of God come to pass in the generation of our children. We are contending for the release of our heritage and the government of God that we know... ?shall be established?.</p>\n<h4>The Present Landscape</h4>\n<p>This promise has begun to unfold many times, only to be aborted. I saw this illustrated in a spiritual picture of a landscape that spread across the boundaries of time. On it were hundreds of elevated points of geography of every kind, from small hills, to subtle mounds, to rocky gagged cliffs. These all represented works done in the name of Jesus and for the Kingdom of God. Each of them was the beginning of what could have been mountains. </p>\n<p>These elevated points also presented opportunities for the ambitious. Individuals hungry for position were drawn to them and coveted a controlling role. But the ambitious were not alone. They were in fact pawns of insidious spiritual entities seeking to abort the true purpose of these places. Like the hills and high places of ancient Israel they seek to control them for their own cause. Unfortunately, all to often they succeed. The disappointment in the picture was that each bulge represented a potential mountain of the Lord?s house. And while some grew to impressive heights, they somehow drifted from their original course .  <br />In this prophetic picture the various high places represented ministries, churches, streams, denominations and movements of every sort. They are like the mustard seed that grows into a great tree and to a degree, and at least for a while represented some aspect of the rule of God on earth. Despite how they began they eventually fell under the control of spirits of idolatry and witchcraft. </p>\n<p>Like with Nebuchadnezzar success can breed an arrogance which causes one to declare, ?Is this not (insert item of choice)... that I have built...?(Daniel 4:30). But God will not share His glory with another. So when pride breeds idolatry a pruning such as what occurred to this king must take place (Daniel 4:14-16). The great tree was cut to its roots in the hopes that humiliation might give place to humility. In the same manner works which began in the spirit were halted and left barren, some forever and some for a season. Rather than becoming towering monoliths of rock for the presence of the Lord they sit idle and possessed of another vision. </p>\n<p>As I reflected on the revelation my heart yearned to provide the Lord a place for His rest. However, I was overwhelmed by the complexity of the task and the purity needed for such a work. It is a ?purity? I personally do not presume to possess but which the grace of God can make possible. It is not a matter of moral standing but a matter of humility. Humility is the key because God gives grace to the humble. Only these can cover us as the mountain of the Lord?s house increases in size, visibility and potential for abuse. <br />The dynamics of growth are easy to understand. As the mountain increases in size, visibility increases as well. This in turn causes it to become a coveted prize in the demonic realm. Having no capacity for rulership in themselves, the demonic hierarchy feeds on what men will yield to them through pride and ambition. Thus the higher a mountain rises, the more attention it draws and authority it wields. The more authority it wields the more warfare surrounds it. It becomes the object of human and demonic covetousness making purity increasingly difficult. </p>\n<p>For this reason we should be careful about judging those who have gone before us. For despite what we know, it is unlikely we have encountered the same spiritual opposition as them. We must be very careful not to fall into the spectator syndrome. Knowing that one ought to pass the puck into the slot or hit that open receiver is simple from the comfort of ?a bowl of chips and the lazyboy?, and that after the third replay. Execution in the heat of the battle is one thing, the evaluations of the academics outside of the parameter the contest is quite another. </p>\n<p>Therefore, if we have any hope of laying hold of the promises, humility must give way to grace in our judgments. Instead, we must grasp the heart of the Lord as a matter of faith, and as a matter of providence. Our grace is that we have fallen to ?kairos? times (appointed times, the fullness of time). Deep in our hearts we know it will happen, not because of us, but because of Him who calls and justifies. Again, the object of our faith and confidence is the promise of the Lord and not our own capacity to prevail. As such, we believe and declare the hope of a generation who will succeed where others have failed. <br />As I pondered the picture I remembered the apostasy of Israel and how every high place had become a seat of idolatry. I saw the strategic importance of the high places as being places of authority. These were the focal point of the enemies? passion. They were power points from which dominion can be exercised. When these places were occupied by idolatry the nation fell into bondage and the prophets of the Lord were forced to hide in caves and the crags of rock.</p>\n<p>The recently released ?Lord of the Rings? movie illustrates very well the predicament we presently face. The rings in the movie embodied tremendous authority that an ancient spirit was longing to possess. Already in control of several rings it was looking to consolidate its power by holding the remaining few. The rings are the same as the mountains in our picture. They are seats of authority that can be used for one purpose or another. The difficulty is in handling the ring (authority). </p>\n<p>The movie illustrated many principles but two things stood out to me. First, anyone near the ring became defiled by its potential power except the character ?Frodo?. Apparently he possessed a purity that enabled him to hold the ring without risk of destruction. The second dynamic was in the way the powers of darkness were drawn to the rings. They did not have to possess cognitive understanding of the ring?s whereabouts to search it out. Meaning, they could be drawn to it without randomly searching. It was as though the rings were scented and could be followed by virtue of their smell. </p>\n<p>Similarly, these two challenges presently face us. There are forces commissioned to possess the mountain we intend to build. In addition, the power of the mountain itself can breed in us all sorts of ambition, which in turn are used against us. So the questions being asked of us are ?Can we be near the seat of power without being defiled?? and, ?Can we overcome the forces which wish to possess the mountain by ourselves being free from ambition??. In short, the warfare is on two related fronts. One rises from within while the other is from without.</p>\n<h4>Idolatry & Witchcraft</h4>\n<p>This warfare can be identified as Idolatry and Witchcraft. Witchcraft from without and idolatry from within. On the one side we are continuously assaulted and circled by vulture like principalities and powers. They circle above looking for an opportunity that might give them advantage. On the other hand we fight the tendency toward idolatry from both within our own hearts and the hearts of those who participate in the building process with us. Witchcraft consists of the continuous stream of curses sent against us that seek for a place to lodge. But the greater danger is the third column that can arise from within,... idolatry. Idolatry is the door that makes us vulnerable to witchcraft. </p>\n<p>Idolatry does not require a systematic worship of idols. It begins as a displacement of affection away from the Lord. That is, when our affections turn from the Lord Himself to that which He is blessing, the idolatry has begun. The dynamics are simple. The more the Lord releases His presence from a particular place or through a particular people, the more people are drawn to it. Appreciation turns to awe, which turns to worship. Soon the place and the people God uses become synonymous with God Himself. It is not unlike any other emotional attachments we form. </p>\n<p>A mother who has raised her children in a particular house forms attachments. After some time the house itself begins to represent her affection and history of care for her family. The two are not the same but when there is a soul tie they are as one. It was with this in mind that Jesus said the cost of being a disciple included having a hate for mother, father and our own life. He was not suggesting we remove ourselves from all family relationships, He was simply dealing with soul ties which bind us to what is natural. <br />Likewise, effective leadership must know how to identify potential soul ties. Even though these ties may seem harmless and natural, they are at the root of idolatry. Affections for a ministry style, a certain personality, or a form of music can each become the beginnings of idolatry in our heart. </p>\n<p>By the same token, any need leadership might have to be praised of honored by the people becomes a potential open door. This is where the mountain of the Lord is at the greatest risk. The more it becomes a habitation for Him the more blessing will flow. This will in turn generate copious amounts of praise and affection from grateful people. It takes an amazing degree of humility to remain unaffected by a continual stream of praise. Personally, I have the profoundest respect for any spiritual leader the Lord can use for any length of time. The more powerfully a church, a stream or an individual are used the more precarious the journey. Like those who scale mountains for sport, the greatest risk is found near the highest peaks. <br />Still, there remains a promise and a hope. While it is critical we understand the nature of the journey, and the impossibility of the venture itself, deep in our heart there is a faith which says, ?It shall come to pass!?. Despite how many aborted journeys we behold or participate in, we know His people will be volunteers in the day of His power (Psalm 110:3). Our hope cannot be in our own humility, giftedness or history. Our hope must remain fixed on the Lord who began it and will complete it.</p>'),(18,'The Gathering Dynamic','<p>This article is written to speak to some issues arising from the conferences called ?the Gatherings?, but speaks to a larger issue which extends to the harvest and how we will cope with the coming expansion of the Kingdom of God)</p>\n\n<p>What is the structure of a Gathering? That is a difficult question to answer because there is little traditional structure. How then does one find his or her place in such an unstructured environment? A place where leaders from different backgrounds are called together to seek the heart of the Lord, while laying down their agendas. What does it mean to lay down my agenda? How can I lay aside that to which, and for which, I was called? How do I find my place and function in surroundings which seemingly provide no slots or positions, asks for no specific credentials, and where success and failure are ill defined, if at all? Welcome to the Kingdom of God, the most dynamic, flexible and unconventional environment in existence.</p>\n<h4>Static Vs Dynamic</h4>\n<p>The challenge and answer to these questions begins long before we come together at a Gathering. I believe it is a tension which surfaces whenever the spiritual kingdom is revealed. This is because the present structure of the Church is static when it should be dynamic. Our tendency is to build things which are resistant to change, whereas the kingdom is always moving and evolving. Once we become accustomed to the static nature of organized activity, kingdom life in the spirit becomes awkward and unnatural.<br />Static refers to something which is no longer in a state of flux or movement. It is not disposed to action and does not possess the qualities which permit for give and take. Something which is static lacks the ability to be flexible. It is designed to move and interact only within clearly defined boundaries.</p>\n<p>In response to this one might ask, \'But doesn?t the kingdom have clearly defined boundaries and principles?\'. Yes, this is true! However, because these principles are spiritual, they can never be outlined in a way which suites the minds of men. The structure of the kingdom is not the structure of men. His ways are not our ways, they are higher. For this reason Jesus could only define the Kingdom through similes. He would say, \'The kingdom of God is like... a seed..., a woman..., a tree..., a man who...\' . Then He would point out characteristics or evidence of the kingdom\'s reality, such as demons being exercised and the poor hearing the gospel. Yet, no one picture could illustrate the kingdom because it is dynamic like the wind ? difficult to trace or map.</p>\n<p>Unlike natural things which can be understood and grasped by observation, the kingdom must be entered and apprehended by faith and revelation. This is uncomfortable to the natural man, and we are not humanly geared to walk or live this way. No matter how long we have been believers, there is a natural inertia pulling us toward static. In fact, the more our place and function has been defined, the more likely we are to allow ?static? to become the norm.</p>\n<h4>The Human Condition</h4>\n<p>>This propensity is of our flesh; it is something resident in our ?natural? man (earthly nature). The disposition of the soul of man is to go from dynamic to static. So then the natural man does not consider ?dynamic? as a feasible option. We simply like things to be predictable; we like to ?nail things down?. \'Who we are\', and \'what is our place\' are issues we desperately want to define. Without it, we feel powerless, insignificant, and unable to function. It breeds an insecurity which makes it risky to venture out.</p>\n<p>This is why we need to become as little children. Children find an unpredictable lifestyle much easier to deal with. Children don?t plan or worry about the future. For them not knowing their place or function is no problem. When children meet they can immediately find common ground and function without answering the questions, ?Who are you??, or ?what are you about?? They move seamlessly from one environment to another, adapting as they go. But the older we become, the less we can tolerate this ?dynamic? lifestyle.<br />When we are in that place, there are too many unanswered questions. It takes a brokeness, a humility and great desperation to operate from a place with unresolved questions. \'Will what I contribute, fit?\' \'Will what I say be accepted?\' We would prefer to have assurances and step out without risk. In the kingdom there can be no such assurances. Our assurance must come from the fact that we know Him and are sure of His voice. The issue before us today is a question. Are we willing to really walk in the spirit?</p>\n<p>The cost of living in the spirit is living in this insecure place. It is something our flesh despises and works to avoid. Why? Because the soul of man cannot keep up with the spirit. The spirit of man can move with the wind of God but the mind is frustrated and exhausted by ?dynamic? structure. Being in a continuous state of flux is taxing to our emotions and minds. It is not unlike having to live your life between two houses ? having moved out of one house but not moved into another. This is the essence of what it means to embrace a dynamic walk in the spirit.</p>\n<p>As a perpetual state of being, this is considered an impossibility. Normally we would only consider it as a condition of transition, tolerable in a short burst between long seasons of static. But this will not satisfy the current need. For we are approaching a time when the season of God?s moving will come in rapid succession. Only those who have mortified the desires of the mind will be equipped to walk in tempo with these seasons. This was Paul?s daily posture and what enabled him to minister the Life of the Spirit. He wrote, ?For we who live are always delivered unto death for Jesus\' sake, that the life also of Jesus may be manifested in our mortal flesh.? However, the flesh is hostile to the spirit and works to resist the dynamic life of the spirit.</p>\n<h4>The Kingdom</h4>\n<p>The kingdom is structured and ruled by observable principles, and yet is advanced only by a willingness to take leaps in the dark. But when there is faith, what is darkness to one is clear to another. The challenge is to live minute by minute, in spontaneous submission to the authority resident only in the Word of the Lord. If we fall back to our reputations and previous function as authority to press forward, we have moved from spirit to soul.</p>\n<p>The Church has fallen backward and leaned on the arm of flesh countless times. We have become like spiritual unions preferring the predictability of seniority over the election of true spiritual authority. We want our place to be secure and waiting for us day after day. We would prefer to think that our words have automatic endorsement and credibility. But we need to know now, that once the harvest comes no one is safe, no matter what position, title, or previous standing they might have had. The only thing which will count is functioning in the spirit.</p>\n<p>While we find it easier to attain a place of respectability and allow that to be our authority, we cannot sink to this level. If we do, we risk being by-passed. To live in the kingdom is to give no regard to position and perception of place, but to simply be obedient again and again. When someone rises up, we should never be asking \'by what authority do you say or do?\'. This in itself is the testimony to our soulish disposition. Rather, those who live in the spirit know that what is spirit and life has an authority of its own. Therefore reputation is of no consequence.</p>\n<p>To function and live this way is the only security we can have ? it is a life of faith. The reason why the young are so ready to embrace this life in the spirit is because they still live in this place of transition. God will use them and anyone else who elects to live in the dynamic structure of the Kingdom, where authority is not based on position and is subject to constant change.</p>\n<p>This was the failure of the leadership of the Jewish nation to which Jesus was sent. Because of this refusal to believe and embrace the spiritual kingdom, Jesus declared that their places would be occupied by others. <br />\'And I say unto you, that many shall come from the east and the west, and shall sit down with Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, in the kingdom of heaven:\' (Matthew 8:11)</p>\n<p>Those who the Lord will use are those prepared to listen and obey. Function in this kingdom hinges not on past history but present willingness. If we look back or consider our own names, we will become static and unable to move. We must be willing to become like little children who have little history and no reputation. In these the Lord will find the servants whose zeal and faith know no bounds.</p>'),(19,'The Fear of the Lord','<p />Imagine a man traveling to a far country looking for a place to build himself a home.  He finds what appears to be a suitable piece of land and begins to build.  After 6 long months of building, and just as he is about to finish his work, he discovers he has built his house on land belonging to a local potentate.  As it so happens, the king in question had already planned to put a vineyard in that very spot.  What are the chances theman?s labor will endure?  Would we perceive his approach to building as wise?  No doubt we would determine him to have acted foolishly and out of presumption.  </p>\n<p>His mistake was in failing to honor, albeit through ignorance, the will and desire of the king.  Certainly, the citizens of this kingdom who were familiar with the king and his desires, would never have made such a critical error.  His mistake could be said to be a lack of ?fear? and a lack of understanding, resulting in a lack of wisdom.  Likewise, our participation in the ministry of the Kingdom, must include a ?fear of God?, which will enable us to build with knowledge, wisdom and understanding.  Crucial elements, if we hope our deeds will function as something more than kindling for the fire of the Lord.  </p>\n<h4>What is it? </h4>\n<p>Unfortunately, in this day of unbridled license (which we often mistake for grace), the ?fear of the Lord? is an unknown and misunderstood commodity.   So what then is the ?fear of the Lord??  Proverbs 9:10 reads: <br />?The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom, and the knowledge of the Holy One is understanding?. <br />The fear of the Lord is the genesis of wisdom.  As such they are closely connected.  One who walks in wisdom also possesses the fear of the Lord.  Inversely, if we have the fear of the Lord, it leads us to wisdom.  But when we speak of the fear the Lord,  are we talking about ?terror??  Is it something which will lead us to hide, or is it, as some have suggested, just respect?  Truthfully it has something to do with both ?terror? and ?respect?.  It is a knowledge of the ?terror of the Lord? which makes us careful to avoid arousing it.  If we have the fear of the Lord we will not have to experience the full measure of His terror. <br />Paul said, ?knowing the terror of the Lord we persuade men?.  The terror of the Lord and the knowledge of it, makes us never want to experience it. Apparently, it brought  Paul to a point where he did not want anyone else to have to experience it either.  Clearly, there is probably much more to this than we can presently know.  But perhaps the best way to understand the ?fear of the Lord? is through its connection to wisdom.  </p>\n<h4>Wisdom and the Fear  </h4>\n<p>Consider this: If the fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom, then to fear Him means to walk wisely and with respect toward His authority.  It means to embrace and walk in what pleases Him knowing there is unpleasantness in doing the opposite.  Since He holds the reigns of power, it is only wisdom to honor that authority!  Those who know this also know there is terror awaiting those who refuse to fear him.  <br />If we build our lives without the fear of the Lord we do so in vain.  For if He truly is the King, only what pleases Him can remain, as He will inevitably do away with everything else.  It is like a parent who instructs their children on how to clean their rooms.  If a certain standard is established the child who is wise will be careful to meet that standard, knowing failure to do so will only mean he has to start over.  In other words his previous work was a waste of time.  Doing it right the first time means he saves in time, energy and the displeasure of his parents.  Unfortunately, the stakes are significantly higher relative to the Lord. <br />The wise spiritual son is also careful to carry out the precise will of his Father.  Since only those things He has sanctioned will endure, the fear of Him calls one to live within the scope of that knowledge ? to live while continuously measuring what one is doing against the express will(standard) of the King.  Our traveler?s presumption came directly from the fact that he did not know the king or the extent of his kingdom.  Thus, wisdom cannot be found outside of a knowledge of the ways of the Lord.  To fear the Lord means to exercise wisdom, which requires a ?knowledge of the Holy?.  If one longs to be productive, wisdom dictates that he work in a manner which pleases the One who has the last word.  Knowing what that last word will be is an undisposable treasure. </p>\n<p>Foolishness is the absence of the fear of the Lord, since it leads men to work as though there is no King.  Their labor is an exercise in pleasing themselves.  Sadly, what is achieved will not endure... no matter how good it looks.  This is true not only in the world but among believers.  It exists in the Church because believers have a superficial understanding of the Lord.  Fruitless labor goes on because we lack a knowledge of the ?Holy One?.  However for two reasons this will not continue for much longer.  The first is He will not permit it.  The second is because the knowledge of the Lord is going to be unveiled and cover the earth.  <br />We are approaching moments of divine destiny wherein the Lord of Hosts will bring an expression of His reign which will shake everything which can be shaken.  The unshakable kingdom will displace all else and the fruitless labor of vain men will become dust.  Then we will truly understand the intent of the Psalmist Solomon who wrote, ?Unless the Lord builds the house, they labor in vain who build it; unless the Lord guards the city, the watchman stays awake in vain.? (Psalm 127:1)  We are approaching a season, especially regarding the Church, wherein those things which are not born of the Lord, will have a very short lifespan.  It is wisdom to distance ourselves from them. </p>\n<p>As in the anecdote in the opening paragraph, there comes a time when everything not built in the fear of the Lord is removed.  It is not removed for spite or as an arbitrary exercise of power.  It is removed to make room for something higher and better; something planned by God and foreseen by prophets.  The significance of John the Baptist?s message was that He was announcing the coming reign of God ? the Kingdom which would replace everything currently occupying space.  It meant the annihilation of all current status and distinctions to be replaced by another system of government.   Having labored and sacrificed for position and honor in a ?false hierarchy?, the rulers of the day could not entertain the idea of another system.  The Pharicee?s resisted because they did not want to lose their place. But there is no stopping the advancing Kingdom of Christ, and all who would not come under that word and humble themselves were doomed to humiliation.  </p>\n<p>This was the first expression of the reign of the Christ which is now closer than ever.  Today the Lord is warning us that yet again another wave of His government is being implemented.  The advance warnings are to get on side and lay our glory down.  There is coming a sword of the Lord to judge and remove everything high and lifted up.   Those who fear the Lord and are wise will hear and take heed.  </p>\n<h4>A Reminder </h4>\n<p>Over the Christmas holidays I received a vivid reminder of this prophetic truth.  While picking up my brother from the airport I inadvertently pulled the hatchback door from my van onto my head.  The impact sent me crashing to the ground opening a 7 centimeter gash (that?s 2 and a half inches for the metrically challenged).  Having closed this door hundreds of times in similar manner I was astonished that such a thing could happen.  After some reflection and a visit to the hospital for 9 stitches, I realized the Lord was using this to speak to me (though I would never consider Him responsible for the incident).  The door represents the Sword of the Spirit which is falling on the Church.  It?s purpose is to bring us into a place of humility or humiliation depending on our posture.  The message is simple ? Lower your head! </p>\n<p>The message advises caution as increased authority is being granted.  The direct result is higher accountability.  We will soon realize there is more power than we ever knew in the things with which we have become familiar.  As with the hatchback, undue care may bring unwanted outcomes.  The fallout of increased authority is a greater responsibility ? ?to whom much is given, much is required? (Luke 12:48).  <br />This increased authority however, is not just a random thing the Lord is doing for us.  Rather, it is a higher expression of Christ?s rule in the earth.  An increase in our authority requires an increase in our responsiveness to the King.  Consequently, the same Sword released in and through the Church to establish the Kingdom will also strike what is elevated beyond it?s proper place.  More than ever, it is a time to recognize the anointings and appointments of the Lord in others, while avoiding presumptuous ambitions for position and stature.  This is a time to humble ourselves remembering the admonition of the Lord:  ?And whoever falls on this stone will be broken; but on whomever it falls, it will grind him to powder?.  <br />To illustrate this I am going to borrow a scene from one of the Indiana Jones movies with Harrison Ford.  He was an archeologist in search of the ?holy grail?, which they believed was the source of eternal life.  Of course every true believer understands the cup Jesus spoke of was not the actual one he was drinking from at the last supper.  Nevertheless, in this story they located it but it was attainable only by passing various tests.  The first poor souls sent to retrieve it literally lost their heads.  Harrison Ford, equipped with several clues, was able to get through.  </p>\n<p>It is the first test which illustrates our intended point.  The clue for getting through the test read, ?The penitent will pass?.  Forced at gunpoint, Indiana Jones, is pushed into a cavern to retrieve the grail.  In fear of his life and having witnessed the decapitation of the first candidates, he desperately searches for the meaning of ?the penitent will pass?.  At the very last moment he realizes the penitent are humble before God, and manages to drop to his knees preventing a mysterious cutting blade from removing his head.  His survival was based on ducking.  </p>\n<p>In this day it is advisable to hold your head low ? to walk in complete humility, free from the need and desire to be honored.  In the final analysis all of us will cast whatever we have before the great Lamb of God.  The moment of this requirement is coming  gradually into focus.  Consequently, the Lord will tolerate less and less of what does not singularly glorify Jesus.  He has promised His Son that ?every knee shall bow and every tongue confess that Jesus Christ is Lord?.  This scripture, as yet unfulfilled, is beginning to unfold and must first be realized in the Church before it will reach the nations.  As it is written, ?To Him must be glory in the Church! (Ephesians 3:21)? </p>\n<h4>The Day of the Lord </h4>\n<p>Indeed ?every knee will bow?, but this is yet to come.  To this point many have prospered and lived in peace who refused to bow their knee to Jesus.  But this day is closing and a new day is dawning.  The day of man is fading while the day of Jesus is beginning to arise. He will be magnified and every voice raised against Him will be judged.   The apex of this reality is called the ?Day of the Lord?.  It is that moment when the Lord will be supremely exalted, leaving nothing to challenge or contend with His supremacy.  Malachi describes it as a time in which the proud are consumed. </p>\n<p>?For behold, the day is coming, burning like an oven, and all the proud, yes, all who do wickedly will be stubble.  And the day which is coming shall burn them up,  says the Lord of hosts, that will leave them neither root nor branch.?(Malachi 4:1) </p>\n<p>This is the moment the Father has patiently anticipated since before the foundations of the world.  Even Jesus spoke in terms in which He yearned for it, saying, ?I am come to send fire on the earth; and what will I, if it be already kindled? ? (Luke 12:49).  It is fast approaching.  The beginning was the outset of Joel?s prophetic word which began to unfold in Acts chapter 2.  Whatever our eschatology, we are coming closer to the moment when all things will be reconciled to Him.  </p>\n<p>After the Spirit was poured out Peter quoted Joel saying, ?And it shall come to pass in the last days, says God, that I will pour out My Spirit on all flesh; your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, your young men shall see visions, your old men shall dream dreams...? (Acts 2:17 from Joel 2:30 )  This began two thousand years ago and is still going on.  But we are at a point of importance in history as the Lord is going to be worshipped among the nations.  The nations will hear and see the wondrous power of our great King and His Kingdom.  The result will be both judgment and unbelievable displays of mercy.  Which side we find ourselves on will be determined by our posture before Him. </p>\n<h4>Handling the Power </h4>\n<p>Whatever our posture He will suddenly appear in His temple (Malachi 3:1).  He will appear with glory as a refiner?s fire and a launderers? soap.  This will inevitably bring great victories as the works of the Lord are manifested in our midst.  It will also birth a restoration of miracle ministries in abundance, as we go on to see the fulfillment of the Word Jesus spoke, when He said we would do greater works than Him.  But while the glory is something to rejoice in, it is also something which must be carefully handled.  It is like nuclear energy, or for that matter, anything else with inherent power.  If not handled properly it will destroy. <br />The coming glory of the Lord is not just to bring a blessing to mankind, though that will is one outcome.  Rather, it is coming to establish the rule of Christ.  Expressions of the Lord?s mercy cannot be separated from the expression of His rule. They are the outcomes of His rule.  For this reason Jesus said, ?if I cast out demons by the finger of God, the Kingdom has come to you?.  The wonderful blessings of the Kingdom of God come as a demonstration of what can be.  But it is for those who come under His rule.  Those who will not repent of their pride will be brought low: </p>\n<p>?For the day of the Lord of hosts shall come upon everything proud and lofty, upon everything lifted up ? it shall be brought low ? The loftiness of man shall be bowed low; the Lord alone will be exalted in that day.? (Isaiah 2:12 & 17) </p><p><br />The power we are speaking of rivals everything known to man.  The Day of the Lord, at it?s apex, includes a complete unveiling of His majesty ? the Word of God expressing the magnitude of His power without constraint.  When one considers that the sum total of all the energy evident in creation, is the result of only six simple statements, ie. ?Let there be light?, what will be the outcome when he once again shouts ?I Am!??  ?The Lord shall go forth like a mighty man; He shall stir up His zeal like a man of war.  He shall cry out, yes, shout aloud; He shall prevail against His enemies? (Isaiah 42:13).  What is the full measure of the Lord?s strength?  What results would come about if the essence of His Being began to become known?  We are going to find out.  If we are to be ready, wisdom dictates we learn to fear the Lord and know His ways. </p>\n<h4>The Principle of Proximity </h4>\n<p>The fear of the Lord and the principle of proximity were something David learned through the death of Uzzah (2 Samuel 6:7).  He was part of the contingency team to bring the Ark of the Lord to Jerusalem .  But when the ox stumbled he put his arm out to steady it and was struck down by the Lord.  Was his sin greater than that of others in the land at that time?  Very unlikely!  The difference was His proximity to that which was designed to carry the Glory of the Lord.  It is noteworthy that this happened despite the Lord?s obvious love and favor on David. </p>\n<p>Today the Church is the Lord?s instrument for demonstrating His glory.  It is through the Church that principalities and powers in the heavenly places are going to know the manifold wisdom of God (Ephesians 3:10).  No other people will stand in closer proximity to that glory than the believing community.  And certainly we will witness, as did the early Church, splendid expressions of the Lord?s restorative power.  But it would be foolish and presumptuous for us to forget Annanias and Sapphira, who lied to the Holy Spirit and were slain by Him. There is higher requirement for those who are near His glory.  Though we are called to carry the glory, we dare not stretch out our hand to touch it. </p>\n<p>The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom and the knowledge of the Holy One is understanding.  We can anticipate and look forward to what the Lord will do.  But if we wish participate in a positive way, we had best understand the fear of the Lord.  A significant part of this fear will come from knowing what He requires.  Knowing what He requires comes from knowing who He is.  </p>\n<p>Presently, the Church has been in spiritual anarchy living recklessly before the Lord.  Like a nation lacking the order of government, a state of confusion, division and turmoil has existed.  We have been a city without building codes, and men have pursued the service of the Lord building ?whatever was right in their own eyes?.  This has been made possible by a lack of the knowledge of the Lord.  But there is a government upon His shoulders which is rapidly emerging(Isaiah 9:6). </p>\n<p>The pattern has been set since before the foundations of the world but is now coming into full view.  Gradually, degree upon degree the King is requiring compliance from His subjects.  Only what is built in wisdom and established in understanding will prevail.  For ?through wisdom is a house built; and by understanding it is established:? (Proverbs 24:3)  Paul declared that as a wise master builder he laid the foundation (1 Corinthians 3:10).  He went on to advise those who would build afterward to build according to the pattern if they wished for their works to be more than wood, hay or stubble.  </p>\n<p>Truly, the proud and the works of the proud will be stubble before Him.  But the fear of the Lord will ensure we labor according to the pattern.  Which is not only His expressed desire but an extension of His heavenly Kingdom through the manifestation of His presence.  This is the rule of God expressed in our midst.  And it is His mercy that preceding this extension of his rule, He utters a Word reminiscent of Habakkuk 2:20 which reads:   ?But the Lord is in his holy temple: let all the earth keep silence before Him.?  Participation in the Kingdom is open to all.  But effective and positive contributions will only occur when we embrace and understand the fear of the Lord. </p>'),(20,'The Favour of God','<p />here is a mistaken idea in the Church that suggests ?God will treat everyone the same?.  The idea comes from the various passages that declare God not to be a respecter of persons.  Does this mean God does not regard one man over another?  Does it mean He will equally respond to the prayer of all.  Absolutely not!  The fact is God does have favorites.   He will ignore the pleas of one while quickly responding to the voice of\n\nanother.  The question is, on what basis will he do so?  The Lord we serve is not a God of our own making.  He is who He is and will not change.  The fact is He finds pleasure in those who are willing to accept Him for who He is and live accordingly.  It is up to us to discover what pleases Him if we hope to live in the light of His favor.</p>\n<h4>What is Faith</h4>\n<p>It is time for us to secure the favor of God and the only way to do that is to please Him.  But what pleases God?  The scripture is clear in this regard ? faith pleases Him (Hebrews 11:6).  But when we speak of faith we are not referring to some abstract or benign belief in a historical Jesus.  We are not suggesting that a vague acceptance of a divine creator is faith.  This is a fine starting point for one who seeks to know God, but faith is the product of actually knowing Him.  He is a God of relationship.</p>\n<p>Faith is God defined in our own spirits.  It is a reflection of who He is, engrafted into our being by us having had an encounter with Him.  An encounter can begin with seeing Him through creation but must mature to a more intimate knowledge.  More encounters means deeper relationship and a clearer revelation of who He really is.  This in turn empowers us to walk in a way that is pleasing to His heart.</p>\n<p>In the interim we should be posturing ourselves to know Him.  We do that by reverencing the things He has already declared and by hungering to hear His Word.  By reverencing we mean applying belief to who He has declared Himself to be without asking for proof.  </p>\n<p>It requires embracing the Word of God as the revelation of Him.  This is why Romans 10:17 tells us, ?faith comes by hearing and hearing by the Word of God?.  The Word of God is not just Biblical sentences inscribed with ink on the pages of a book.  The Word of God is a spiritual force released from the mouth of God carrying the power to convey who God is, and is in fact God Himself.  Hence Jesus is called the Word of God.  All of which gives us faith, a commodity that is somewhat more than ?strong belief?.</p>\n<p>The truth is God likes those who are like Him. The more we resemble Him the deeper our fellowship.  To begin with, His mercy enables us to come to Him, but the intent is for us to then become like Him.  Though we will always require mercy, friendship with God is the thing to pursue.  The man who has power with God is the friend of God.  And the man who walks with God is the one whose voice the Lord will regard.  To live only in the realm of His mercy alone is to miss the intent for which He gave us redemption.  Every great man of faith rose to a place of friendship with God. </p>\n<h4>The Friends of God</h4>\n<p>In terms of relationship the Lord is not much different from us.  We all have people with whom we are more intimate.  Why have we chosen them over others?  Primarily it is because they please us. We can walk together and enjoy their presence because we have something or a lot of things in common.  The one key difference when walking with the Lord is that we are the ones who have to change.  When we find ourselves out of sync with God we can be assured the error is always on our side.  He is the Lord and He does not change, ?nor does He need to.  Thus our ability to walk with Him is directly related to how prepared we are to consider Him the standard with which all things are measured.</p>\n<p>Moses was a man who became the friend of God.  Even among great men of God the standing He obtained was unique.  He spoke with God as one man speaks to another.</p>\n<p>?And Jehovah spoke unto Moses face to face, as a man speaks unto his friend.? (Ex 33:11)</p>\n<p>As such Moses held a special place in the heart of God.  God would do things for Moses which He would never consider doing for another.  Both He and Samuel are singled out as having particular power within the heart of the Lord.</p>\n<p>The scenario surrounds the impending doom of the nation after repeated prophetic warnings.  Apparently they had passed the point of no return and the Lord was going to judge them.  Though on other occasions the Lord sought for a man to intercede that He might have more mercy, He made it plain that no amount of intercession from Jeremiah would save them.  At this point we see something about what it means to have a special favor in the eyes of the Lord.</p>\n<p>?Then the Lord said to me, ?Even if Moses and Samuel stood before Me, My mind would not be favorable toward this people.?? (Jeremiah 15:1)</p>\n<p>In other words as much as I regard these two men even their intercession could not sway me.  Still if anyone could move the heart of God in an impossible situation, the most likely to do so would be Samuel or Moses.  These men held an amazing place in the heart of God.  On another occasion the scripture declares concerning Samuel that ?none of his words ever dropped to the ground?.</p>\n<p>?And Samuel grew, and Jehovah was with him, and did let none of his words fall to the ground.?  (1Samuel 3:19)</p>\n<p>What does it mean when the Lord will not let your words drop to the ground?  It speaks of being in a place of unusual favor.  Samuel was so liked by the Lord that even if he strayed in his prophetic declarations the Lord would honor him and do the things Samuel said. </p>\n<p>Again and again throughout scripture we see men to whom the Lord showed unusual favor.  When He was about to judge Sodom the Lord came to Abraham saying? ?Shall I hide from Abraham what I am doing??  There was no obligation to tell Abraham anything, but we like to tell our friends what we are doing.  This is also why the Lord will do nothing unless He first speaks to the prophets.  They are his friends!<br />Also when a man is your friend you are quick to hear Him.  This is where the power of intercession meets the friendship of God.  The truth is God will be quick to answer his friends but not necessarily others.  What does it mean then that God is no respecter of persons?  It simply means that all have equal opportunity to become the friends of God but not all avail themselves of that opportunity.  Draw near to God and He will draw near to you.  The opportunity to draw near is for all of us but there is a price to pay in drawing near ? we must change.  This is not a 50/50 relationship where there is give and take on each side.  He is the Lord and He does not change. </p>\n<p>One of the things we realize as we mature is that refusal to enter into intimacy is rooted in an unwillingness to change.  Willingness to change, on the other hand, is the foundation of faith.  Faith is a product of an intimacy with God.  When the Lord finds a man or woman willing to draw near and lose who they are to gain Him, He finds in them a friend with whom He can walk.  These ones always have His ear.</p>\n<h4>Powerful Intercession</h4>\n<p>The rewards of drawing near and becoming like Him are many.  Primarily we get to enjoy the beauty of who He is.  The discovery is great, the effect on our being is bliss.  But besides this we gain power to affect the heart of God.  Who wants to cry to the Lord for years and not be heard? </p>\n<p>The very first day Daniel begins to seek the Lord for wisdom He was heard.  The story plays out in Daniel 10 where he is visited by an angel.  Consider for a second the words uttered to Daniel.</p>\n<p>??O Daniel, man greatly beloved, understand the words that I speak to you, and stand upright, for I have now been sent to you.?  While he was speaking this word to me, I stood trembling.  Then he said to me, ?Do not fear, Daniel, for from the first day that you set your heart to understand, and to humble yourself before your God. Your words were heard; and I have come because of your words.?? (Daniel 10:11-12)</p>\n<p>Not only is he a man considered greatly beloved of the Lord but the moment he begins to pray he is heard.  You have to wonder why it took 400 years of suffering and crying before the Lord came to deliver the descendents of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob?  Could it be that there is a difference between a cry of murmuring and complaining and a cry of faith. Could it be that the Lord sought for a man of faith to rise up those 400 years and found none.  Finally, the oppression is too great and mercy kicks in.  What a difference!  Four hundred years of screeching is worth less than one day of faith and relationship.  If we had a choice to be like Daniel or the children of Israel, which would you choose?</p>\n<p>The point is there are some people who know the Lord and can come to Him on the basis of who He is.  This is a prayer of faith.  Murmuring and complaining is an insult to God.  Its very tone is an affront to the nature of God.  It presumes He will not act and that He is deaf to the cries of oppression.  Unfortunately, God will respond according to our faith and will be to us, as we believe Him to be.  If we consider Him a hard taskmaster, that is who He will be to us.  Again, God responds to faith and is annoyed by whining.  As such He is not unlike most fathers.  When I hear that high pitched squealing and complaining it only grates on me.  It makes me want to leave the house in search of peace and quiet.  But when my son or daughter appeals to what they know is justice in me it is easy to respond.  The tone or spirit of an appeal makes the world of difference.</p>\n<p>Mind you, age and maturity are taken into account.  When a three year old whines you tolerate it to a degree and train them how to speak.  But when they are fourteen and still whining it becomes less tolerable.  Similarly the Lord has great grace for the spiritually immature but when we ought to be mature and are not, that is an entirely different story.</p>\n<h4>Another Principle</h4>\n<p>The truth is our faith has everything to do with the Lord?s approach to us.  In Matthew 25 Jesus tells a most interesting parable of the Kingdom of heaven.  It is the one where servants were given talents numbering five, two and one.  When the master returned and the one who received one talent was discovered to have done nothing, there is an amazing interchange.  The lazy servant describes the Lord as being ?a hard man, reaping where you have not sown, and gathering where you have not scattered seed? (Matthew 25:24). While we clearly understand this is not the truth, the Lord responds as though He were these things, taking no issue with his definition.  Suddenly the Lord is to him the ?hard man?.  In many instances, though not always, we receive according to our faith and our unbelief.  This is no condemnation but a challenge to allow our vision of God to be changed.</p>\n<p>Jesus encouraged the disciples with many insights into the nature of God.  He said, ?Fear not, little flock, it is the Father?s good pleasure to give you the kingdom? (Luke 12:32).  He said, ?Take no thought about what you should eat since God feeds the birds of the air, and we are much more important than them.? (Matthew 6:25-34)  This is who God is!  When we approach Him knowing these things the shrill whine of unbelief is gone.  This is pleasing to Him.</p>\n<p>When we choose to believe less of the Lord than what He is, that is often what we get.  But when our understanding of Him matches who He is, it releases the favor of God.  The Lord is honored when out of a clear revelation of His kindness we appeal to His nature.  This is faith!  Mercy is available, but He will have mercy on whom He will have mercy.  Why take the chance of His notice when friendship is available?  Why wait for God to pity us when we can rise in accordance with His plan and call on His name?  There is a place of favor reserved for many but enjoyed by few.  The time has come for us to choose where we will stand.</p>'),(21,'The Father\'s House','<p />The Prophet Isaiah spoke saying, \'Heaven is my throne, and earth is my footstool.  Where is the house that you will build Me?  Where is the place of My rest?\' David interpreted the heart of the Father thinking he--David-- should build the Lord a house.  The truth is God is building a house.  The Father\'s House will be a\n\ndwelling place from which all the earth will know and see His glory.  It will be a house wherein God will dwell with man, and display His workmanship.  He is not looking for us to build Him a place of rest.  It is a work which only His hand can perform.  He only looks for those who will labor in simple obedience.</p>\n<h4>The Revelation of God</h4>\n<p>God has made a habit of visiting men.  Though men have no power to know Him, the Lord chooses places and times where He unveils himself.  He visited Abraham for the purpose of revealing Himself.  Abraham possessed no worthiness which could compel God; this was the Lord\'s idea.  But a visit from God is not like a visit from a man.  You cannot meet with God without being enriched.  Why?  Because He is the essence of goodness. In fact the Lord told Abraham, \'I (the Lord) am your exceedingly great reward\'.  Abraham received something so perfectly satisfying it is impossible to describe with words.  For how can we describe consummate goodness.  But what he received could not be confined.  It would ultimately extend so that\'all the families of the earth would be blessed\'(Genesis 12:3).  This was the essential plan.</p>\n<p>Many years later, the Lord meets Moses.  Again, the initiator is God.  Moses is much like a victim in a sense; a bystander caught up in events to which he gave no life.  It is important for us to take note of this and consider that this is God\'s plan.  He began it and will finish it.  The Lord decided the place and time, and without prior provocation reveals Himself to Moses.  He even went so far as to declare His name as the great \'I Am\'.  One can almost see a pattern developing.  Whenever a fresh stage of the Lord\'s redemptive plan is to unfold God reveals Himself somewhere to someone.  Both Moses and Abraham mark important transitions in the Lord\'s program.</p>\n<p>Up to the days of Abraham the Lord blessed the occasional man with His presence.  With Abraham He promised a nation to be distinguished by a unique relationship with Himself.  With Moses came the first concrete step toward that aim.  But was God choosing Israel in order to reject the rest of humanity?  No!  It was only one step towards reconciling the human race.  From the very outset the Lord has purposed to reconcile the nations by revealing His glory on the earth.  But in so doing the Lord also purposed to bring all of creation to it\'s knees in worship.  He would do this by displaying the incredible breadth of His great power and wisdom.  Each phase of the program unfolds with precise accuracy, revealing the depths of His unimaginable glory.  Just when it seems creation has tasted the limits of His greatness, yet another curtain draws back to show us more.  The stroke of genius, and certainly the death blow to the kingdom of darkness, is seen in the life, ministry, death and resurrection of Christ.</p>\n<p>The Lord sends Jesus as a part of the next phase of redemption.  This is God\'s most significant effort.  To this point men have caught glimpses of God.  But now we see Jesus, an exact expression of the \'glory\' of God; albeit veiled in human flesh.  \'And the Word became flesh and dwelt among us, and we beheld His glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father, full of grace and truth.\' (John 1:14)  Through Jesus more of God is revealed. It is so astounding, it eclipses every prior expression of who He is.  Though everything we understood Him to be to this point is true, it was only incomplete.  In Jesus the revelation is much fuller.  So much so, that some have tried to make a distinction between the God of Jesus and the God of Moses.  They are of course the same!</p>\n<h4>A Gradual Revelation</h4>\n<p>It would be fair to say that history is a progressive revelation of God.  Rick Joyner makes note that the very word \'history\' can be said to say \'His Story\'.  When we look back on history this will be the only true perspective.  The knowledge of God is like a ship approaching on the horizon, it becomes in increasingly clear, until one day the whole earth will be filled with the knowledge of His glory\'. (Hab. 2:14)  Jesus came with the direct intent of revealing the Father and prayed, \'I have manifested your name to the men whom You have given Me out of the world.\' (John 17:6)  The apostle John later wrote, \'No one has seen God at any time.  The only begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, He has declared Him.\'  It is significant that John summarises the ministry of Jesus as having \'declared the Father\'.</p>\n<p>At this point some may wonder at the fanfare.  After all, if God is intent on revealing Himself to man why does He not just simply do it?  This is a complex question with many valid answers.  One being because God is a beautiful and powerful treasure.  As one does not cast pearl before swine, He will not unveil Himself recklessly.  Also there is an issue of mercy.  Who can look steadfastly into the brightness of light after being in the darkness for any length of time?  The stage of human history is being gradually lit so as to give men an opportunity to adjust.  The light may blind just as well as it may illuminate. It depends how it is presented.  Since we are accountable to the light we are given, God would be unjust to blind men with the brightness of His coming.</p>\n<p>More specifically though, the Lord is using the history of the world much like one would stage a play.  Every act is sculpted with precision to bring an exact conclusion.  The plan of God is deliberate in the most magnificent of ways.  Men would never suggest unveiling a brand new coliseum without some kind of inaugural ceremony.  No King is presented to the people without some kind of demonstration of their honor and worth.  Even so, with painstaking wisdom, the Lord has designed a program for all of creation to ultimately see His glory.  In doing so all of creation will be awe struck at the breadth of His infinite wisdom and power.  Indeed the Lord is intent on two things: In a step by step fashion He is displaying His most awesome strength, while as the same time removing every shadow of doubt about His right to be honored and adored above all that He has created.  The revelation of God is therefore calculated and meticulous.  One significant phase unfolds through the Tabernacle in the Wilderness. </p>\n<h4>The Tent in the Wilderness</h4>\n<p>The program began with the awesome demonstration of the Lord\'s might against one of the greatest powers on earth: The Pharaoh of Egypt.  It is noteworthy to remember how it was done.  God chose an otherwise insignificant man on the back side of the desert.  This is His way; calling the weak, the things which are not to confound the things which are. Afterwards He led Israel into the wilderness, to Mount Sinai.  Here He would show more precisely who He was.  It was that classical moment when the glory of God descended to the mountain top.  In fact, they did not even see His glory, only the \'fallout\' of His physical manifestation.  So awesome is the Lord that smoke and fire are the result when even a portion of Him comes into contact with the natural realm.  All they encountered was His voice.  But His voice alone is enough to bring the bravest man into a state of terror.</p>\n<p>\'Then it came to pass on the third day, in the morning, that there were thunderings and lightning, and a thick cloud on the mountain; and the sound of the trumpet was very loud, so that all the people who were in the camp trembled...Now Mount Sinai was completely in smoke, because the Lord descended upon it in fire.  Its smoke ascended like the smoke of a furnace, and the whole mountain quaked greatly.\' <br />(Exodus 19:16&18)</p>\n<p>This was the beginning of God\'s incredible revelation to the nation of Israel.  The sheer greatness of God makes His revelation somewhat like demonstrating the might of nuclear power.  It must be done carefully within the parameters of strict guidelines.  The guidelines are for the protection of the people whom the Lord is revealing Himself.  The merging together of the eternal power of the Godhead, with the frail finite natures of men, is no simple task.  At one point the Lord is compelled to give a severe warning to the people.  In their eagerness, there was a chance they might press pass the designated boundaries to \'gaze at the Lord\'.  The outcome would be that the power of Lord would break out against them, to their own demise.</p>\n<p>As a safe vehicle for His presence among them the Lord instructed Moses to prepare a sanctuary for Him.  He instructed Moses to ask the children of Israel to bring offerings of various materials, saying: \'And let them make Me a sanctuary, that I may dwell among them.\' (Exodus 25:8)  This statement foreshadows the Lord\'s desire for a house to dwell in.  Finally after all the materials were gathered the tent finished, the ark was in its place the glory of the Lord descended on the tabernacle.</p>\n<p>\'Then the cloud covered the tabernacle of meeting, and the glory of the Lord filled the tabernacle.  And Moses was not able to enter the tabernacle of meeting, because the cloud rested above it, and the glory of the Lord filled the tabernacle.\' <br />(Exodus 40:34-35)</p>\n<p>From these verses we can see something from the heart of God.  It is the Lord\'s heart to dwell with men.  Even the prophetic name of Jesus, Immanuel-God with us- reveals the purpose of God.  The Lord desires a dwelling place; a place of rest for His glorious presence; a place where He can show Himself.</p>\n<h4>Solomon\'s Temple</h4>\n<p>Years later the Lord calls Solomon to build a temple.  Solomon writes, \'and behold, I propose to build a house for the name of the Lord my God, as the Lord spoke to my father David, saying, \'Your son, whom I will set on your throne in your place, he shall build the house for My name.\'\' (1 Kings 5:5)  So Solomon used the materials gathered by his father and built a spectacular edifice of gold.  Upon its completion the Lord visits with His glory as He did the tabernacle of meeting in the wilderness.</p>\n<p>\'And it came to pass, when the priests came out of the holy place, that the cloud filled the house of the Lord, so that the priests could not continue ministering because of the cloud; for the glory of the Lord filled the house of the Lord.  Then Solomon spoke: \'The Lord said He would dwell in the dark cloud.  I have surely built You an exalted house, and a place for You to dwell in forever.\'\' <br />(1 Kings 8:10-13)</p>\n<p>Solomon, not having the same prophetic bent as his father, vastly overstated the usefulness of this particular building.  Would his temple be a dwelling place of God forever?  Solomon could not comprehend the vastness of the plan of God which would stretch over the course of all human history.  This temple was not to last forever.  Though the Lord seeks a place of rest, it is not one which can be built by the hands of men.  The contribution of man ceases at the point of faith and obedience.  What then was the purpose of the temple?  How does it fit in to the overall program of God?  It was one more step towards the building of an eternal temple. <br />When David first expresse</p>\n<p>s His desire to build the Lord a resting place, it is because he heard something from the heart of God which he could not initially understand.  How often \'we see in part\' and act prematurely.  Even though his initial plan was a little presumptuous his heart was the right place.  The Lord responds to David through the prophet Nathan.  The Lord asks \'have I ever spoken a word to any of the tribes saying, \'Why have you not built Me a house of cedar?\'\' (2 Samuel 7:7)  The answer of His question is a resounding and emphatic \'No\'!  Continuing, the Lord speaks these strikingly prophetic words.  \'Also the Lord tells you that He will make you a house.\' (vs 11) Within these words we can see the blueprint of an eternal plan.  That is , God is building a house.  David sees the eternal purpose of God and rejoices.  He praises the Lord for revealing this truth saying, \'For you, O Lord of hosts, God of Israel, have revealed this to Your servant, saying \'I will build you a house\'\'. </p>\n<p>What David saw at this time was that the work of the Lord was not about temporary houses or tents.  Though it was the Lord\'s desire to have a resting place for His glory,  David now understood that it was to be a \'house made without hands eternal in the heavens.\'  Acknowledging the insight he happily resigns his own desire to build something.  \'Now therefore, let it please You to bless the house of Your servant, that it may continue before You forever;\'(vs 29).</p>\n<p>Call it a weakness; call it what you will, but is clear that men long for the conclusion of a thing.  In our shortsighted egocentric manner we constantly try to fit the plan of God into the tiny frame of our life.  Men down through history catch a glimpse of what the Lord is attempting to build, and immediately assume they are called to bring it to pass.  The fact is, human flesh is frustrated and disillusioned by anything larger than what he believes he can do.  So when God reveals the blueprint of His program, we instinctively reduce it to fit into a human context.  But the Lord is not asking us to build anything. Rather, He is the master builder.  He is not looking for architects, or engineers, only laborers. People who will be content with a very tiny piece of the overall plan.  The most significant contribution we can make is to treasure the vision and believe in the one who is building.</p>\n<p>Speaking in human terms we can understand the program of God by looking at a larger construction project.  If an organization planned to build a large new hospital in a given city there would be steps to follow.  First, the building structure must be conceived.  Once that is in place then the location must be nailed down.  At this point the support of the community at large must be harnessed by giving the people a vision of what it is you want to build.  One common way of doing that is to create a small but identical scale model of the structure in question.  When this is put on display or publicly unveiled, the community can begin to grasp the beauty and wonder of the project.</p>\n<p>Likewise the Lord has a house in His own heart.  A resting place for His presence, through which the earth to be filled with His glory.  The tabernacle in the wilderness, and the temple of Solomon were beautiful and powerful expressions of the glory of God.  But they were mere scale models of the ultimate structure, which is spiritual in substance.  It is inevitable that the Lord will complete His house.  In a sense, it is a given fact that the whole earth will be filled with His glory.  For to this end God has committed Himself.  The only necessary ingredient from the man\'s side is obedient and humble men.  The flesh of man is too ready to believe that he can build a house.  But anything man builds will fall dismally short of the Father\'s heart.  So what is the ultimate temple and house of habitation which God is building?</p>\n<p>\'Now, therefore, you are no longer strangers and foreigners, but fellow citizens with the saints and members of the household of God, having been built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ Himself being the chief cornerstone, in whom the whole building, being fitted together, grows into a holy temple in the Lord, in whom you also are being built together for a dwelling place of God in the Spirit.\' <br />(Ephesians 2:19-22)</p>\n<p>The house which the Lord is building is us.  We are being assembled to be a dwelling place of God. Peter calls us living stones (1 Peter. 2:4).  Revelations speaks about being a pillar in the temple of God (Rev. 3:12)  The scriptures are full of references to the building which He is doing.  Not the least of which says, I will build My Church and the gates of hell will not prevail against it.  In the end the structure will be finished; completed with substance which does not fade, wither, or fall.  Finally when the mystery is complete a loud voice will declare in heaven, \'Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men, and He will dwell with them and they shall be His people.  God Himself will be with them and be their God.\' <br />(Revelation 21:3)</p>'),(22,'The Eyes of the Lord','<p />When we pray ?Your kingdom come?, we are asking for the dominion of God to come from heaven.  We are asking for a dynamic atmosphere that will make it difficult,\n\nif not impossible, for evil to flourish.  There is coming and now is, a level of prophetic intercession which releases the eyes of the Lord through the Church.  At its peak, the people of God are essentially invisible to the enemy?s gaze, but the activities of the demonic are always known.</p>\n<p>The enemy needs a shroud of darkness to do what he wishes to do.  But when the eyes of the prophets are open, everything the enemy devises to do is known.  This is reflected in the account of the king of Syria and Elisha.  Every time they attacked Israel, her armies mustered at the precise points of conflict.  Believing himself the victim of treachery the king begins to seek out the mole, only to discover a prophet in his own chambers.</p>\n<p>?? but Elisha, the prophet who is in Israel, tells the king of Israel, the words that you speak in your bedroom.? (2 Kings 6:12)</p>\n<p>The prophetic vision in Israel at this time made it impossible for them to be surprised.  Everything her enemies attempted to do in secret was made known.  This provides for us a picture of the rule of God expressed in our midst.  There is a sight and open vision which comes in the manifestation of the Kingdom.  This vision makes it possible for us to walk in safety and prosperity.  Jesus was aware of this dynamic and knew when it was safe to move and when it was not.</p>\n<p>When he was asked to heal his friend Lazarus he would not go.  He and His disciples had just come from Judea and the Jews had sought to kill Him.  Naturally the disciples supposed the reason for not going was the threat of the Jews.  This was secondary in the mind of Jesus.  He was waiting for the movement of the heavenly host that would make His passage safe and invisible to the principalities and powers.  When questioned He said this: ?Are there not twelve hours in the day?  If anyone walks in the day, he does not stumble, because he sees the light of this world.  But if one walks in the night, he stumbles, because the light is not in him.? (John 11:9-10)</p>\n<p>In as much as we cannot see in the night, the enemy cannot see in the day.  The day symbolizes the places and times of the Lord?s covering.  When we are covered, the enemy cannot touch us.  This of course is contrasted against the arrest of Jesus in the garden when He declared, ?But this is your hour, and the power of darkness? (Luke 22:53).  Before this time the enemy had attempted repeatedly to take Him and could not.  On one such occasion he escaped while in plain sight (Luke 4:29-30).  Though a mob surrounded Him He simply ?passed through the midst of them?.  The point being that when the day has come, the night no longer has power.</p>\n<p>In the Lord of the Rings story there is metaphor of two kingdoms.  As the power of darkness rises over the land, the eyes of the demonic are enabled to see the righteous.  When the righteous attempt to operate in the realm of the spirit, they are greeted by the eye of Satan and a voice declaring, ?I see you?.  Similarly, where the body of Christ is not moving in its authority the people of God are easily targeted by the enemy.  But the day is dawning.  There is a new authority coming to the Body of Christ.</p>\n<p>Vision is coming to prophetic intercessors who will rise in the realm of the spirit.  They will enter the threshold of the ?eyes of the Lord?.  When the enemy begins to prowl, like a motion detector revealing a thief, he will be detected.  There is a watch in the camp of the Lord rising to say ?I See YOU!!? Like the king of Syria, everything the enemy attempts to do will come under the scrutiny of the government of God.  So again we pray, ?Your Kingdome come, Your will be done on earth as it is in heaven.?</p>'),(23,'The Danger of Pretence','<p />Typical Christianity encourages a general dislike for the evils of the world, encouraging believers to walk in a godly manner.  The sins of the flesh are viewed with disgust as they are considered pollutants of pure streams.  It is a healthy conviction that the believer should avoid all worldly influences which might serve to \n\nmuddy the waters of one\'s soul.  However, there is an equally destructive activity which is not only tolerated, but in some cases eagerly encouraged in the Church.  This insidious, evil, and innocently embraced behaviour, is called pretence.  Pretence is a poisonous influence which must be completely erased, if we are to enjoy the fullness of God.</p>\n<h4>Stagnation</h4>\n<p>When a believer opens themselves to pornography, fornications, lust and other such sins, they jeapordizes their walk and the purity of their soul.  Participating in these forms of behaviour would be like dumping raw sewage into a stream.  There is also a less obvious way of polluting the waters of our soul though; it is through stagnation.  Stagnation is defined as a body of motionless water which has become foul. <br />A motionless pond without inlets or outlets is said to be \'stagnant\' -- these waters, even if undefiled by vast amounts of waste, will lose their ability to sustain life and become polluted.  In similar fashion the soul of man can be polluted by a lack of outlets and inlets.  This occurs when believers disguise and enclose themselves for the purpose of living up to outward appearances of holiness.  The activity of concealing oneself, to the point where we actually believe we are whom we pretend to be, creates a destructive climate in our inner man which will ultimately lead to spiritual poverty.</p>\n<h4>How it happens!</h4>\n<p>A Church environment may have preset qualifications or standards for social promotion. There can be a subtle but very real disdain for deviation from these accepted norms of outward appearance.  Even if the standards arose out of something as innocent as a desire for more godliness, they can easily become a perverse form of natural selection; a religious \'survival of the fittest\'.  The ambitious, strong willed, and intellectually capable will rise like cream.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, struggling believers are likely to hide the fact that they cannot measure up, rather than risk rejection.  Wanting desperately to feel a part of the illusive inner sanctum and fearing rejection if they do not conform, Christians are bound into a pretentious and artificial conformity.  Whatever source of the standard, no amount of human flesh is going to achieve lasting godly transformation.  Any change in us resulting from willpower, the desire to advance, or the fear of rejection will never yield the Kingdom of God in our midst.</p>\n<p>When believers buy into the outer value system of a particular religious stream, they can try to play the part.  This is done by suppressing who they are in order to dawn the garb of the \'successful\' believer.  That is, it becomes more important to appear, or believe myself to be Christlike, than to actually be Christlike.  All the while, lurking beneath the thin veneer of \'successful Christian living\', there is a growing sense of incompetence as the real you aggressively battles for center stage.</p>\n<p>The refusal to turn to God in humble weakness and repentance, is the very thing which empowers our flesh.  James says that when we harbour ambition and envy for men\'s acceptance, confusion and all evil will join them. (Paraphrase of James 3:16)  Like a garden whose weeds are never plucked by the roots, there is a never ending struggle to maintain a beautiful appearance, while the weeds of our soul grow relentless in their pursuit of visibility.  Despite all our effort to change ourselves, no permanent headway is being made as the weeds continue to make their presence known.  Eventually, we will be exhausted by our effort to maintain the veneer and conceal our lack of genuine change.  For many, this marks the beginning of transformation as they truly reach out to the Lord for change.  For others, disillusioned by the lack of reality in their own lives and Churches results in a regression to nominal Church existence, or a complete falling away.  The worst scenario exists when one has achieved influence and standing as an elder or pastor.  He may believe there is too much to lose for the game to cease.</p>\n<h4>A Typical Scenario</h4>\n<p>This cycle begins with the salvation experience of a young man or woman who commit themselves to becoming all they can be.  Their zeal causes them to dive headfirst into Church life.  Before long they are introduced to spiritual worship, spiritual language, and spiritual dress.  Quickly conformed to the most obvious standards of outward appearance, there grows a sense of belonging.  Without knowing it, the believer is being schooled in a system of rewards and subtle alienation, depending on their performance.</p>\n<p>As they begin to deal with sin problems in their life they find the help they receive to be superficial and awkwardly administered.  The fallout of their openness is not immediately noticed, but after several such incidents, they cannot help but feel that their confessions have created a stigma around them.  Feeling a sense of alienation, they decide it was perhaps unwise to be quite so open, and think that these issues are better dealt with internally.  This is the beginning of pretence, as a foundation for the life of spiritual chameleon has now been laid.  It is only a matter of time before the poisonous issues of their soul become completely unbearable and impossible to camouflage.  Sooner or later the shambles of such a life comes to the forefront as pretence buckles under the weight of reality.  Is this what real Biblical Christianity is about?  Not in the least!</p>\n<h4>What is Christianity?</h4>\n<p>Christianity is not to be a religion of self-imposed service, discipline, or sacrifice.  Christ intended that His followers would love the unlovely, not coerce them into hiding their deficiencies for our comfort.  Jesus vigorously denounced the external religion of the  Pharisees who devoted themselves to outward piety while denying an internal corruption.  Their\'s was a religion of pretence, as they exalted the power of the human spirit to control and suppress the unattractive issues of the heart.  Christianity is not a means of concealing our corruption, but a relationship with One who is able to love and change us despite His knowledge of our deplorable state.  Our acceptance before the Lord is not based on our ability to conform, but on our willingness to humbly expose our lack of conformity before Him.  The Church, as an extension of the Lord and His ministry, ought to reflect the same spirit.</p>\n<p>The Lord has called us to reach out to the sick in heart, soul or spirit.  The Church is meant to be a hospital for the socially and spiritually ill, not a performing arts club for the talented and the together.  The only way that meaningful change will come to the lives of Christians is when believers are encouraged to be real, without fear of alienation.  This does not mean we tolerate any form of expression and sin, it means your value as a member of this assembly is not measured by your ability to demonstrate Biblical virtue.  It means you do not have to fear not belonging because you struggle with sin.  It means we are here to see you change and will bear patiently while the Spirit of God digs out, not only the surface of the weed, but the roots which are buried deep in your heart and soul.</p>\n<p>The Lord had not intended the church to be a company of individuals gathering weekly to parade their improved quality of lives or their flawless character.  We desecrate the sacred calling of the believing community by creating a upwardly mobile, limelight seeking system of promotion based on external perfections.  It is shameful that new converts are coerced into a depthless conformity of parroted behaviour, in order to be perceived as worthy of attention and acceptance.  If there was anywhere that believers ought to feel comfortable with their imperfections and struggles it ought to be with other believers, and yet we know this is not often the case.  This scenario results in a outwardly attractive but powerless Christianity which Watchman Nee addresses with clear candour.</p>\n<p>\'Too many of us are caught acting as Christians.  The life of many Christians today is largely a pretence.  They live a \'spiritual\' life, talk a \'spiritual\' talk, adopt \'spiritual\' attitudes, but they are doing the whole thing themselves.  It is the effort involved that should reveal to them that something is wrong.  They force themselves to refrain from doing this, from saying that, from eating the other and how hard they find it all!  It is just the same as when we Chinese try to talk a language that is not our own.  No matter how hard we try, it does not come spontaneously; we have to force ourselves to talk that way.  But when it comes to speaking our own language, nothing could be easier.  Even when we forget all about what we are doing, we still speak it.  It flows.  It comes to us perfectly naturally, and its very spontaneity reveals to everyone what we are.\'</p>\n<p>Christianity is not a religion of conformity but transformation.  The simple truth is that God gives grace to the humble and the humble is the one keenly and honestly aware of his need.  When we glorify the finish and ignore the race itself, we impose on people a godless sense of shame for not having \'arrived\'.  This produces nothing but human effort and a denial of need.  In this we shut up the waters of our soul and refuse the free flow of Christ\'s life giving water.  No matter how good that water appears to be in the beginning, in the end there will be nothing short of a poisonous slough, yielding only some obscene form of religious death.  Jesus clearly pronounced the pathway to life when He said \'You shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free\'.</p>'),(24,'The Consequences of Rebellion','<p />It is rebellion for us to take what God has not given.  Such rebellion has it\'s reward.  Instead of more we end up with less than we had in the first place.  Rebellion foolishly believes it is possible to circumvent the rule of God; to somehow sneak around and find a loophole.  This is a serious miscalculation!  The testimony of scripture and human experience tell us there is always a terrible price to pay.  Whether the price is\n\nobvious is of no consequence, God will not be mocked. He is Lord and King!  He knows everything we think and do.  His all knowing power makes it impossible to escape His reach.  Whether or not man wishes to respect the Lord, He continues to rule unmoved by man\'s ambition.  He continues to dispense reward and punishment as is good in His sight.  If we are wise, we will quickly take this to heart.</p>\n<h4>Ridiculous Wisdom</h4>\n<p>Unfortunately, mankind has been cursed with a strange and depraved wisdom.  It shows itself in both children and adults alike.  My daughter recently decided to be innovative in the use of a certain word; what it was, I do not remember.  I then explained that nobody would understand her; that the word would mean something totally different to everyone else.  She responded that \'this was the way she was going use it\'.  She said it as though her meaning would be as valid as everyone else\'s.  These kind of wild assumptions can sometimes be cute in children.  They rise out of ignorance. Children can be oblivious to the real world.  However, these kind of assumptions are nevertheless wrong, and must be corrected before they lead to more serious ones.  As I explained to my daughter, there are very good reasons why we do most of what we do.</p>\n<p>The fallout from ignorance in children is not a severe problem and can be easily corrected.  It is not so simple a problem when the adult community follows suit.  The need to \'do it my way\' has perverted our society.  While the rebellious think it a matter of freedom of expression, they do not realize they are actually challenging the rule of Almighty God.  He alone is perfectly familiar with the realities we would label normal.  Alternate morality is not a simple matter of choice affecting only the individual.  It is a defiant pride which accuses the goodness of God as though He were evil.  It is a challenge to His right to rule His creation.  The Lord\'s first response seems to be simple amusement.  As if He were saying, \'Look at these silly powerless men, waving their fists in the air, shouting meaningless and trivial threats.\'  But His laughter soon turns to anger and judgment in the face of persistent arrogant defiance.</p>\n<p>\'Why do the nations rage, and the people plot a vain thing?  The kings of the earth set themselves.  And the rulers take counsel together.  Against the Lord and against His  Anointed, saying, \'Let us break their bonds in pieces and cast away their cords from us.\'</p>\n<p>He who sits in the heavens shall laugh; The Lord shall hold them in derision.  Then He shall speak to them in His wrath, and distress them in His deep displeasure; Yet I have set my King On My holy hill of Zion.\' <br />(Psalm 2:1-6)</p>\n<p>Man will never escape the boundaries of God\'s rule no matter how hard he tries.  God has appointed His King in Zion.  Were it not for His great love, and eternal purpose, He would have disposed of this petty annoyance centuries ago.  Man, who has been given the greatest honor of any created thing, continues to judge himself unworthy.  We can only guess how the angels must envy the opportunity offered men.  Still, mankind passes by heavens treasure preferring the glitter of fool\'s gold.  One wonders how many times the Lord has considered choosing another option.  In His frustration with Israel He almost did.</p>\n<p>\'And the Lord said to Moses, I have seen this people and indeed it is a stiff-necked people!  Now therefore, let Me alone, that My wrath may burn hot against them and I may consume them.  And I will make of you a great nation.\' (Exodus 32:9-10)</p>\n<p>Moses wisely appealed to the Lord\'s own honor to avert swift judgment.</p>\n<p>Initially God laughs.  He laughs at man\'s naive blindness.  It evokes pity over the fact that man can be so easily and deeply deluded.  In vain, men surrounds themselves with laws as corrupt as their own hearts.  They declare things to be true which are not, and worse yet, ignorantly believe them to be so, based on the authority of his own flawed and perverse thinking.  It is as though a man perched himself over the precipice of a cliff declaring gravity to be irrelevant.  Can he abolish what is, by simply declaring a thing to be outdated or non-applicable?  Never!  The established order cannot be changed by the perverse whims of men.</p>\n<p>Yet, man continues to scoff at the Lord who is holy.  He says homosexuality is as natural as heterosexuality, and foolishly trusts that because he has believed it, it must now be so.  When a man decides he will sleep with another man, and there is no reason in his view for not doing so, he cannot escape the reality of law.  The scripture says \'And likewise also the men, leaving the natural use of the woman, burned in their lust one toward another; men with men working that which is unseemly, and receiving in themselves that recompense of their error which was meet.\' (Romans 1:27)  What is morally true and what is right cannot be derived by democratic means.  These realities are defined by God alone and no human can escape them.  They are good because God is good.  Both in His gentleness and His severity we can trust that He is perfect in righteousness; absolutely correct in judgment.</p>\n<p>In keeping with this fact Paul wisely advises men to not be deceived.  You cannot escape the domain of God\'s influence.  Whether or not government agencies enforce just penalties, sin will not go without accounting.  Sometimes the consequence of our sin can go unnoticed for a very long time.  But without a doubt, every seed sown will bring forth a return.  Whether our sowing is for good or for evil it does not vanish simply because it has departed from the realm of our understanding.  In fact, if we can learn anything from gardening, we should know that it is the unwanted seeds (weeds, thorns & thistle) which prove to be the most resilient.  All unrepented sin will bring a harvest.</p>\n<h4>Communal Showers</h4>\n<p>A recent radio news program carried a story which illustrates the principle of sowing and reaping.  The story was on the closing of communal (not coed) showers; that is, a large open room sporting multiple shower heads.  It seems the showers are not being used by University and College students.  All across the continent they are being taken out of commission.  Apparently, this generation is being struck by a profound case of modesty.  Too modest to shower with their peers, they are choosing instead to run home to clean up after physed classes.  This is particularly ironic seeing as these are the offspring of the 60\'s generation. <br />You might remember them as the ones who were going to revolutionize human sexuality.  Throwing off the restrains of \'Victorian puritanism\' they vowed they would be \'free\'.  Their motto, as stated by John Lennon, was \'naked and not ashamed\'; a perversion of scripture.  They believed rejecting \'outdated\' morals would bring them into blissful union with their bodies; that embracing sexual liberty would remove the shame of nakedness.  They believed their parents restrictive values brought the shame.  But their rebellion would accomplish no more than Lucifer\'s or Adam\'s.  Instead of achieving a sense of healthy self-worth, they have passed to their children an increased sense of shame.  It is impossible to circumvent the law of God. <br />Man feels shame because he has been touched by sin.  Every additional rebellion will only enhance man\'s sense of shame and guilt.  It cannot be avoided, shifted, or annulled without submitting to the authority of Christ.  The problem is not the guilt and shame, the problem is the sin and rebellion.  As described in Psalm 2, man desires to \'break their bonds in pieces and cast away their cords \'.  The sentence for this is guilt, shame and fear. It is the natural fallout of leaving the domain of God\'s rule.  This harvest will continue to be reaped until man is redeemed though the blood sacrifice of Jesus Christ.  No throwing off of laws or morals can ever free man, because the earth is the Lords and the fullness thereof. </p>\n<h4>The Biblical Pattern</h4>\n<p>The first tale of rebellion is found in Isaiah.  Lucifer, who was created in majestic splendor, coveted a position reserved for the Lord himself.  In his boasting pride he proclaimed his ascension into the Lord\'s seat.  His arrogance deceived him into believing he could actually make himself like God.</p>\n<p>\'How you are fallen from heaven, O Lucifer, son of the morning!  How you are cut down to the ground, you who weakened the nations!  For you have said in your heart: I will ascend into heaven, I will exalt my throne above the stars of God; I will also sit on the mount of the congregation on the farthest sides of the north; I will ascend above the heights of the clouds, I will be like the Most High.\' <br />(Isaiah 14:12-14)</p>\n<p>A proud boast indeed.  The Lord would deal with this rebellion in a precedent setting fashion.  His judgment on Lucifer gives us the pattern for the future.</p>\n<p>\'Yet you shall be brought down to Sheol, to the lowest depths of the Pit.\' <br />(Isaiah 14:15)</p>\n<p>He strove for the heights but has reaped the depths.  Ultimately, he will be cast into the lake of fire, there to remain for all eternity.  His final state becomes the reverse of what he thought to possess.  In like manner, those who rebel to improve their lot, will inevitably find themselves lower as well.  Whether the authority is parental in nature, from society, or directly from the Lord, the outcome will be the same.  No one can seize a desired position, place or function outside of the Lord\'s promotion without bringing judgment upon themselves.  It may be delayed, or it may come in a less than obvious form, but when you cast your bread upon the water, it will return.</p>\n<h4>Eve\'s Temptation</h4>\n<p>When the Lord placed Adam and Eve in the garden He made the guidelines very clear.  They were to eat of all the trees in the garden except for the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.  The potential for increased wisdom, which was a lie, is worth noting. </p>\n<p> \'For God knows that in the day you eat of it, then your eyes shall be opened, and you will be as gods, knowing good and evil.  And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was pleasant to the eyes, and a tree to be desired to make one wise, she took of the fruit of it, and ate, and gave also to her husband with her; and he ate also.\' <br />(Genesis 3:5-6)</p>\n<p>Adam and Eve coveted knowledge the Lord had not offered and would now suffer a similar fate as Lucifer.  They would not achieve the promised wisdom and power.  Instead, mankind would be hurled into an abyss of perverse wisdom leading to ever increasing darkness.  No longer would they enjoy the comfort of the garden, painless childbirth, or soil easily yielding its fruit.  Instead of becoming wise, man fell into dungeons of foolishness.  His sin had now separated him from the source of true wisdom.  He is lost at sea holding a compass with no fixed point of reference.  While the delusion of rebellion promised progress they were sadly disappointed. </p>\n<p>As with Lucifer the harvest of rebellion proves to be ugly indeed.  But what is perhaps most significant is the immediate result of their rebellion.  Before this they did not have a hint of self-consciousness.  Now they felt shame to the point where they had to hide their nakedness.  Rebellion produced shame.  How ironic!  Here we are six thousand years later experiencing a similar by-product of rebellion.  The 60\'s generation can produce nothing better than Adam and Eve.  Adam and Eve hid themselves in fig leaves while the current generation is forced home to shower.  The result of rebellion will always be alienation from God and a heightened sense of shame.  It is impossible to covet and, in a manner of speaking \'steal\', without losing the very things we previously owned.</p>\n<h4>Stored Wrath</h4>\n<p>The picture we see being unveiled before us is serious indeed.  For God has been most patient and lenient with man.  But He will not do so forever.  The Lord has given us ample evidence to know that His rule cannot be usurped.  Paul said \'knowing the terror of the Lord, we persuade men\' (2 Cor. 5:11)  In the Greek the word terror, means exactly what it means in English, however uncomfortable this might be for some.  The Lord God great in mercy and longsuffering has offered man the single greatest opportunity the creation has ever known.  To eternally rule and reign with the magnificent Son of God.  In His mercy God has repeatedly visited man only to be repulsed, cursed at, spit upon and dishonoured in every way.  Showing love and forgiveness is His very nature, yet man stubbornly continues to rebel.  Like the citizens of the parable in Luke 19:14 they have \'hated him, and sent a message after him, saying, We will not have this man to reign over us\'. Concerning them, He later went on to say, \'But bring here those enemies of mine, who did not want Me to reign over them, and slay them before me\'. </p>\n<p>Adding insult to injury, man shows himself again and again the enemy of God by choosing to side with the Barabbas\'s of the world.  This in itself is a witness against his own heart, as men will love their own.  Jesus said, \'I am come in my Father\'s name, and you receive me not: if another shall come in his own name, him ye will receive.\'(John 5:43)  Facing a similar response Paul wisely articulates the heart of God when saying, \'It was necessary that the word of God should be spoken to you first; but since your reject it, and judge yourselves unworthy of everlasting life, behold,we turn to the Gentiles.\' (Acts 13:46)</p>\n<p>God has shown Himself to be more than tolerant in His love, but there is an appointed limit to his patience.  In fact, His longsuffering is part of the program to exhibit His goodness and justify His severity.  For \'What if God, willing to show His wrath, and to make his power known, endured with much longsuffering the vessels of wrath fitted to destruction:\'(Rom. 9:22).  Someone once wrote \'all the world is a stage\'.  The history of the human race is the story of God\'s love and His power, displayed before the host of heaven.  When the curtains of time have lifted the severity of man\'s evil and the beauty of the Lord\'s justice will be abundantly clear.  The script of human history showing God\'s extended arms will tell no lie.  There will be no confusion.  The creation will know that each and every judgment of God on sin was a warning.  The days of man will be a testimonial of a God who went to impossible lengths to show mercy, only to be humiliated, rejected and repeatedly insulted.  What will be he measure of His justified anger when it comes?  \'For the great day of His wrath is come; and who shall be able to stand?\' (Rev. 6:17) </p>\n<p>Though men continue to reject Him as their King, He responds as He did in the second Psalm,\'Yet I have set my King On My holy hill of Zion.\'  The rule of God is a sure bet.  Still, we are given an option of sorts.  All who say \'we will not have this man(Jesus) to reign over us\', will get their wish.  \'But \'He that believes on the Son has everlasting life: and he that believes not the Son shall not see life; but the wrath of God abides on him.\' (John 3:36)  It is time for the Church to come to grips with the reality and severity of the coming judgment.  Unfortunately many have humanised the love of God, resulting in tragic conclusions.  The Lord is admonishing His Church to get on side much like Paul did the Corinthians.  \'And having in a readiness to revenge all disobedience, when your obedience is fulfilled.\' (2 Cor. 10:6)  Lest we be reckless and slothful both in our lifestyle and witness we should remember Peter\'s words. \'And if the righteous scarcely be saved, where shall the ungodly and the sinner appear?\'(1 Peter 4:18)</p>\n<h4>Today\'s Gospel</h4>\n<p>These are not Old Testament truths, they are the words of Jesus and the words of the Apostles.  The message of the coming wrath of God is not anti-love.  Rather, it is the second side of the two-edged sword.  The message of the fear of God and His approaching wrath are missing components of today\'s gospel.  It is a paradox of sorts. God in His love has afforded the ungodly countless opportunities to enter His Kingdom.  As we draw near to the end of time, that door of opportunity will shut, and man will receive the justice he deserves.  When that door shuts, no man will be able to open it again.</p>\n<p>\'Anyone who has rejected Moses\' law dies without mercy on the testimony of two or three witnesses.  Of how much worse punishment, do you suppose, will he be thought worthy who has trampled the Son of God underfoot, counted the blood of the covenant by which he was sanctified a common thing, and insulted the Spirit of grace?</p>\n<p>For we know Him who said, \'Vengeance is Mine, I will repay, says the Lord. And again, \'The Lord will judge His people.\' <br />It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God.\' <br />(Heb. 10:28-31)</p>'),(25,'The Burden of the Lord','<p />The Lord is about to release renewal and revival to His Church. He promised the whole earth would be filled with the glory of the Lord(Num 14:21). To do this He will simply speak. It is His declared Word which brings the Kingdom of Life. However, before He speaks there must come a cry from the heart of His children. \n\nThis cry is not an ordinary request or petition, but the result of intercession from the Spirit. Already, he Church has begun to experience the deep groanings of the burden of the Lord. As with childbirth, bearing the burden will ultimately lead us to the moment of delivery -- the moment He speaks a new wave of life into His Church.</p>\n<h4>The Spoken Word</h4>\n<p>When God speaks it is no small thing. For when He speaks, He accomplishes far more than the communication of information. The Word spoken from the mouth of God is the expression of His nature. When He wishes to communicate Himself He speaks. Thus Jesus is called the Word of God -- the essence of God \'declared\'. The Lord Almighty spoke the incarnation, revealing Jesus as the \'brightness of His glory and the express image of His person\' (Hebrews 1:3). Likewise when the Lord wills to do something within a people or a nation, He simply speaks. Whether it is blessing or judgment the declaration from His mouth is the moment of birth. </p>\n<p>When the Lord does speak, He is not just articulating His thought;, nor is He simply expressing an idea. Rather, He is expressing the very substance of that idea. God imagined the Creation, but it did not begin until He said, \'Let there be light\' (Genesis 1:3). When He chose to renew the Church in righteousness by faith, He spoke the Word. The outcome was a fountain of revelation forming a river which flowed throughout the earth.</p>\n<p>When the Lord speaks His Word does not return void since it is intrinsically empowered to produce. In other words God\'s \'doing\' is contained in His speaking. For Him \'action\' and \'talk\' are one in the same. When something needs doing God speaks. Each stage of restoration throughout the course of Church History has come about as the Lord has spoken. Furthermore, many of the things He spoke 200 years ago, continue to flow to this day. Restored truth (Kingdom Realities) once established, perpetuate themselves for years to come. This is true whether it concerns the truth of healing, sanctification, the Holy Spirit\'s power, etc.  <br />The renewal of life in the Church is the outcome of God having declared it over His people. This can be seen in everything from Creation, to the Incarnation, the Reformation and so on. It is critical for us to know this because He is about to speak again. More than that however, there is a process we must participate in, before He will speak. </p>\n<h4>The Cry of Intercession</h4>\n<p>While at times the Lord seems to boldly intrude in the affairs of man, He has largely limited Himself to the agency of man. When something needed doing He sought for a man. He chose Abraham in order to obtain a nation and Moses to deliver Israel from Egypt. The Lord Himself became a man in order to bring us salvation(Isa. 59:16). When He wished to spare a nation from judgment, He sought for a man to stand in the \'gap\'(Eze. 22:30). </p>\n<p>The entire process begins when the Lord places on someone the burden of His heart. We can call this the burden of the Lord. Once a person or a group of people receive the burden of the Lord, they carry it to birth in the womb of their spirit. When it is brought to the fullness of time it then manifests.  <br />The terminology is quite deliberate since carrying the burden has parallel\'s to carrying a child. The birth pangs of this spiritual labor are characterized by a sense of being \'troubled\' and by deep \'groanings\' in one\'s spirit. Paul writes concerning the creation which groans in labor for freedom from sin. It too is awaiting birth.  <br />\'Because the creation itself also will be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the children of God. </p>\n<p>For we know that the whole creation groans and labors with birth pangs together until now.  <br />Not only than, but we also who have the firstfruits of the Spirit, even we ourselves groan within ourselves, eagerly waiting for the adoption, the redemption of our body.</p>\n<p>Likewise the Spirit also helps in our weaknesses. for we do not know what we should pray for as we ought, but the Spirit Himself makes intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered.\'(Romans 8:21-23 & 26) </p>\n<p>When we carry the burden of the Lord we yearn for the labor to be complete; we long for the birth. There is a strong sense of expectation and discomfort. It is like listening to a melody without hearing the final note or phrase. Something within us longs for resolution. Without it we are troubled, feeling the tension of this expectation without the joy of realization. However there comes a time when the burden is fulfilled. This is point where the Father speaks and we see the promise. </p>\n<p>This kind of intercession can take place at many different levels. As mentioned above there is a \'groaning\' for the redemption of our bodies. This relates to the Lord\'s vision to fill the earth with His glory -- the moment when we \'see Him as He is\' and our bodies change in the twinkling of an eye. On the other hand we may be called to carry the burden of the Lord for our nation or locality. Then again, our calling may involve personal burdens from the Lord relative to our Church or extended family. Whatever portion we are called to carry is not important. Rather, we give ourselves to the faithful exercise of that burden.</p>\n<p>For most of us it takes some time to even begin to recognize the burden of the Lord. For example it is quite likely for one to misinterpret the sense of being troubled in the spirit. It can result in us becoming frustrated with people and circumstances when we are actually wrestling in our spirit. We may ascribe this state to being dissatisfied with our work or home. We may project this feeling or dissatisfaction onto others without realizing we are carrying the burden of the Lord. </p>\n<p>Personally, I have only recently discovered the degree to which I have carried the burden of the Lord. Looking back I can see this same dynamic in my personal and ministry experience. For example, all the significant moments when the Lord spoke profoundly to me were preceded by the burden of the Lord.  <br />Once such occasion was just a few years ago as I found myself at a important junction in my life and ministry. I needed to make a decision to change my situation in the face of trying circumstances. As with most of these kinds of decisions there seemed to be a lot at stake.</p>\n<p>I struggled for weeks to know the mind of the Lord. There only two possible options and no matter how much I considered either, I could get no peace. Then one day as the sense of being troubled found its peek, I could do nothing but travail before Him. That was when He spoke. Once He had spoken, the peaceful assurance of His word flooded my soul. Though I had no more information than previous to this moment, my dilemma dissipated. More than that, I saw that my inability to come to a decision was the effect of the burden of the Lord. </p>\n<p>I had been \'troubled\' and \'groaning\' from the burden as it grew in intensity for some weeks. It was not just something I did while in the prayer room, it was something I carried in my spirit wherever I went. Furthermore, this was not a worry or a fear, but a part of the yoke I was meant carry. This kind of burden is common to the Christian experience since it originates from the Lord. As we will see it was also a part of the ministry of Jesus.</p>\n<h4>The Jesus Pattern</h4>\n<p>Leading up to some very special moments we see Jesus experience similar things. His soul is troubled as He groans within Himself. He is yearning to hear the Father.  \'\'Now My soul is troubled, and what shall I say? Father, save Me from this hour?  But for this purpose I came to this hour. Father, Glorify Your name.\' Then a voice came from heaven, saying, \'I have both glorified it and will glorify it again.\' <br />Therefore the people who stood by and heard it said that it had thundered. Others said, \'An angel has spoken to Him.\'  <br />Jesus answered and said, \'This voice did not come because of Me, but for your sake.\'\'(John 12:27-30) <br />Jesus begins by declaring He was troubled. He is referring to the burden of the Lord which results in the Father speaking from heaven. The \'troubled soul\' is the effect of carrying the burden of the Lord without which God will not move.</p>\n<p>In the next passage we see a similar process leading up to the resurrection of Lazarus. Just before he is raised there is an interaction between Jesus and the Father which is entirely spiritual. It begins when Jesus came to see Mary and she falls at His feet weeping. </p>\n<p>\'Therefore, when Jesus saw her weeping, and the Jews who came with her weeping, He groaned in the spirit and was troubled.\'(John 11:33)</p>\n<p>His spirit was in intercession causing Him to groan inwardly. In this case the power of God\'s resurrection life had begun to stir. It began with a deep burden from which He could get no relief. Though groaning does not lift the burden it seems to be the only way to express it. Shortly afterward we see Him weeping(vs35), followed by more groaning in verse 38.</p>\n<p>\'Then Jesus, again groaning in Himself, came to the tomb. It was a cave and a stone lay against it.\' <br />Jesus groaned within Himself. The heaviness in His spirit along with the deep troubling of His soul, were a part of the process leading up to the release of God\'s life giving power. In essence these things make up the cry of intercession. Amazingly, Jesus begins praying out loud by saying \'Father, I thank you that You have heard Me.\'(vs41) It is amazing since He had not yet spoken to the Father. Rather, the Father and He had already communicated via the spirit in prayer.</p>\n<p>This pattern is part of the essential process through which the Lord moves on the earth. Before significant initiatives are realized there must come a cry from the spirit of man. A similar cry precedes the deliverance of Israel from Egypt. Moses, moved by the Lord, climbs Mount Horeb to see the bush which is not consumed. Here the Lord tells Him He has heard the cry of Israel.</p>\n<p>\'Now therefore, behold the cry of the children of Israel has come to Me, and I have also seen the oppression with which the Egyptians oppress them.\'(Exodus 3:9)</p>\n<p>Before the Lord could speak to release the children of Israel, there had to come a cry from the people. The same applies today! While the Lord will do what He will do, it will involve this process. </p>\n<h4>Coming Glory</h4>\n<p>Jesus said \'that which is spirit is spirit and that which is flesh is flesh\'. We are called to bring to pass what is spirit and life. Like Jesus we must live and minister by the burden of the Lord. This is how things are born of faith which overcome the world.</p>\n<p>The time is approaching when the Lord will speak concerning a great many things. As such the need to carry the burden of the Lord is approaching it\'s climax. It may not mean we will all spend hours a day on our faces. It does mean some portion of the Lord\'s burden is being distributed to us. Many have already begun to experience great levels of travail without realizing it. For some the burden is evident through a vague sense is frustration or uneasiness. Others may find themselves particularly emotional. The different characteristics are not important. What is important is that we begin to understand what this is really about. <br />We may or may not know the nature of the burden we are carrying. Sometimes we will know and sometimes we wont. Our understanding is not always necessary. An expectant mother does not need to know the sex, eye color, or size of her baby to do her part. Nor is that information helpful in knowing she is with child. What is important is that she nurture the \'earnest expectation\'. </p>\n<p>As the Lord\'s children we are a part of something colossal. If there was one part we can all play, it is this. The burden of the Lord is to see the whole earth filled with the knowledge of the glory of the Lord. As this same expectation is carried in the womb of Creation so it has been given to us. \'Let us be glad and rejoice in it\'!.</p>'),(26,'Anatomy of Conflict','<p />If you have not discovered it by now, we live in a rather confusing world. The boundaries of right and wrong are as stable as the waves of the sea. When it comes to conflict, each side is always convinced that it is right and the other party is wrong. Each side claims to hold the high ground. But no matter how highly we might regard our own capacity to think objectively, the truth is we are heavily influenced by \n\n  self-interest. Humanly speaking, this means no one can ever be 100% sure of his or her own ability to judge correctly or fairly. As Christians however, God has given us His Holy Spirit which He promised would lead us into all truth.</p>\n<h4>The Power of Truth</h4>\n<p>The greatest gift the Lord has given us for our daily life is the gift of the Holy Spirit. Even so, having the Spirit of Truth in one?s possession is no guarantee we will make full use of Him. For though we have access to truth, the question then, is not whether we can get the truth, but do we want the truth. For as much as we may think ourselves to be lovers of the truth, the abundance of unresolved conflict is evidence of the opposite. This fact in itself should drive us to the fear of God. It should inspire us to readily take up the challenge of 2nd Corinthians 13:5 which says, \'Examine yourselves, whether you are in the faith, prove your own selves.\' As much as we may be convinced of our opinion and position, we should be prepared to examine our heart issues. The Apostle focuses his point with a further statement in verse 8, saying, \'For we have no power against the truth, but for the truth.\' His intent was to suggest that the strength of our standing hinges on the degree to which we are in the truth. Therefore, if we are going to enter conflict we had best ensure we are in fact standing on the side of truth and not our own agendas.</p>\n<p>This was not the first thing Paul had to say about division. In dealing with the Corinthian church?s division, he makes an amazing statement. One which, if it were not true, would suggest he was deluded with arrogance. On the other hand his enemies no doubt thought him arrogant, despite his being correct. He wrote, ?But he who is spiritual judges all things, yet he himself is judged by no man.?(1 Corinthians 2:15) The assertion he is making has to do primarily with his own claim to objectivity. He is not affirming the Corinthians but himself as being one who is spiritual and the Corinthians as being carnal or childish(1 Corinthians 3:1-3). Still, one who is sincere, but not as sure of himself as Paul was, might question, \'How could he be so sure he was right?\'</p>\n<p>This is, in fact, the question we should want to answer. ?Is there a way you can know with absolute certainty that you are right?? Or put another way, ?that you are in the truth?? The answer is an unequivocal ?yes!?. The same certainty available to Jesus and the apostle Paul is ours for the taking if we have the courage to embrace the truth. But what truth do we speak of? Are not all believers in possession of the truth. No doubt all believers would claim to have embraced the truth on the grounds that they believe the Bible. But this is not what we are talking about. The Pharisee?s claimed to have the truth because they believed the written scripture. All such religious posturing is of no regard. For if the possession of scripture or the belief in one?s own sincerity were any guarantee, division among believers would be impossible! Rather, we need to look away from the arena of Biblical to the standard we can call ?spiritual?. This is not to say we ignore Scripture. But, for the moment, we need to set aside the idea of correctness, as it can be used to mask heart issues which need to be challenged. After all, this was the standard Paul referred to when dealing with the Corinthians. He contrasted a spiritual mindset against a carnal one. He never spoke of the ?Biblicalness? of his position but the subjective ?spiritualness? of his life.</p>\n<h4>Mature vs Immature</h4>\n<p>The problem begins first of all because we think in terms of right and wrong. Let?s instead exchange the dynamics, and language, away from right and wrong and over to mature and immature. In other words the right response is the mature response and the wrong response is the immature response. This is, after all, what Paul pointed to in his correction of the Corinthian believers. In essence he was saying that the amazing level of childish response was the actual problem. The father heart within him did not want to commend on the basis of right and wrong, but to motivate maturity. This is exactly what we try to do as fathers in the home.</p>\n<p>For example two of my older kids might come to me complaining that the other has done something wrong. Usually it amounts to ?he said/she said?. The truth is it matters little who is right and who is wrong, as I am more interested in age appropriate responses. My parenting responsibility is not to only solve the current problem, but includes an attempt to call the older child into accountability. What usually surfaces is a claim of emotional superiority. The older one holds to the opinion that the younger is infinitely less mature. The conclusion being, therefore I must be right. My response is an attempt to show the criteria of maturity. In other words, you might think you?re superior, but your attitude and response demonstrate that you are pretty much on the same level as your brother or sister.</p>\n<p>This truth becomes more obvious when looking at children with much greater age gaps. In our family we have 4 kids all close in age. Then there is Tiffany who is 5 years younger than the others. Tiffany is now 3 and a half while the next oldest is 8 and half. When Tiffany doesn?t get what she wants she might accuse the others of being mean or nasty. Mostly this is greeted with tolerance, amusement and understanding. The older kids are not engaged by Tiffany?s taunts and do not enter into conflict. Why? Because the obvious maturity gulf between this little one and the others is too great. Even though Tiffany might be genuinely unhappy, her little outbursts are too insignificant to threaten the others. A posture of defensiveness is not necessary. In other words, the older kids demonstrate an age appropriate response. This itself is the evidence that they are in fact more mature. And if mature is equivalent to being right, they would be right.</p>\n<p>On the other hand the taunts of the 11 year old toward my 13 year old are not so easily dismissed. No, they are eagerly greeted with emotional engagement of the highest order. In fact, the four older ones all seem to be able to solicit a response from each other. What does this tell me? It tells me that despite the age difference they are emotionally very much on the same level. Meaning, being right is less important than being in relationship, and that my friends requires maturity. It does not mean we ignore being right, but we realize being right is of no value without being mature.</p>\n<h4>The Spiritual Application</h4>\n<p>Now applying this to our church situations should bring us to the same conclusions. Which is to say, we are not spiritually superior to those who successfully engage us, whether or not we believe them to be wrong. The goal of our instruction Paul said is love (1 Timothy 1:5). Those who are actually mature walk in a higher level of understanding and grace toward the immature. When we see our flesh responding, the truly mature will pull back from the conflict and examine themselves. The immature will look for ways to justify an evil heart by ?he said/she said?he did/she did?.</p>\n<p>Does this not mean that right and wrong no longer matter? No so! They continue to be important, but they are defined not by argument but by love. That is, the one who is most like to advance the kingdom is the one who holds no grudge and bears no ill will. James wrote that the wrath of man does not produce the righteousness of God. Therefore being right is only slightly better than being wrong. However, right flesh is as useless as wrong flesh when it comes to producing the Kingdom. If we are actually right but move out of envy, strife and ambition, we are in no position to advance the kingdom of God.</p>\n<p>Therefore the issue of right and wrong ceases to be the preeminent question. Those whom God approves are the ones who pursue the kingdom of God, while at the same time, walk in righteousness towards the rest of the body. If we find our flesh engaged and enraged, it is not the time to justify ourselves. For if we love the truth we should already know there is a problem. It may or may not regard our position, but it does regard our person. And while we may be accustomed to using issues to deflect attention away from our person, we should know that ?we have no power against the truth?.</p>'),(27,'First Level of Intercession','<p />As believers we are all called to intercede and pray for our towns and cities.  Even so we may not all be intercessors in our callings and ministries.  An intercessor being, by definition, one who \n\n  devotes six to eight hours a day in prayer. However, each of us can play a crucial role in intercession with little effort.  As the Church we are called to be salt and light. Salt is used as a preserver. It hinders the progress of biological corruption.  Likewise we can preserve the lives of others in our communities and cities.</p>\n<h4>A Child Shall Lead Them</h4>\n<p>The most obvious way we can be salt and light is by raising the moral barometer of our communities.  Whether it is with family, co-workers or friends, we stay the flow of wickedness by our lack of consent.  My five year old son gave a wonderful demonstration of this last summer just outside our front driveway.  In short, he simply said \'No!\', to evil.</p>\n<p>This particular scenario involved a group of 4 to 6 year olds.  As is often the case we can usually find one or two with a deviant need to control.  Behind this activity is a spirit determined to wound and destroy by fear and rejection.  It usually manifests in the statement, \'Were not going to be your friend today!\'.  While it wears a more sophisticated face in the adult world it amounts to the same thing. Some poor soul is left out of the loop.  My son simply said \'No! We will play with you.\'  The child in question was included and that was the end of it for the time.  When we openly refuse to participate in unrighteousness we stem the tide of wickedness; we are in the gap; we are intercessors.</p>\n<h4>Sodom & Gomorrah</h4>\n<p>Abraham demonstrates a more direct form of intercession.  When the Lord came down from heaven to speak to him, the Lord told him of impending destruction.  The Lord was about to judge Sodom and Gomorrah!  In response Abraham wisely appeals to the mercy of the Lord saying, \'Will You also destroy the righteous with the wicked?\'.  Abraham, knowing God will not punish the righteous on account of the wicked, entreats the mercy of the Lord.</p>\n<p>As their dialogue continues Abraham appeals on the basis of the righteous.  \'If there are fifty righteous, will You spare the entire city?\'  The Lord agrees!  Abraham, discerning their are not fifty, lowers the number to forty, to which the Lord again consents.  This continues until the Lord concedes to spare the entire city for the sake of ten righteous men.  Unfortunately there were not ten, there was simply Lot.</p>\n<p>Although Abraham\'s intercession did not save the cities, imagine another scenario.  What if there were ten or twenty righteous in the city?  Certainly, the Lord would have spared it.  If He had spared it, what does this tell us about the equation of intercession?  We can clearly see the role of Abraham, but we should consider the righteous within the city.  It is the righteous which give the Lord a reason for mercy. <br />The heart of God is seeking for reasons to withhold wrath.  We can be that reason.  When the righteous live amongst the unrighteous their literal condition is one of intercession.  Such intercession is passive but vital.  It does not require a lot of time, only a firm commitment to live before the face of the Lord. <br />Conclusion</p>\n<p>The first level of intercession is \'a must\' for all believers.  As the Church begins to heed the call of prayer for cities, we might be looking for a place to start.  We can begin here.  Start by actively believing for the favor of the Lord to be poured out on our neighbors and fellow citizens.  As you begin to cultivate the attitude of an intercessor the Lord will grace with an increasing burden and responsibility for you city.  Then, you can step into deeper and more active roles.</p>'),(28,'Surviving a Spiritual Firefight','<p />The Christian life is a call to war.  The battles are as real as the casualties! Like most wars, there is a time to advance, a time to retreat and a time to simply hold your ground. It is not always easy to know which of these three actions to take.  We may even think anything but \'being on the attack\' is defeatist.  Howbeit, there are times when the best thing to do is keep our shield up and our head down.  It\'s not a matter of\n\ncourage or cowardice, it\'s a matter of wisdom.  If we listen to wisdom, our greatest victories can often come on the heels of the enemies fiercest assaults.  Therefore, knowing how to survive a spiritual firefight is uniquely important to the Christian soldier.</p>\n<h4>The Artillery Fire</h4>\n<p>Recently I found myself in the midst of an all out offensive.  Unlike natural warfare, it can take days to process what we are facing.  Like any surprise attack, the longer we go without taking action, the more of our strength we surrender.  In this case I was distracted by the pomp of the Christmas season.  I attributed the difficulties I was having to busyness and the activity associate to the Christmas Holidays.  Unfortunately, our enemy knows this is an open door and does not recognize seasonal cease fires.  For this reason we are admonished to \'Be sober, be vigilant; because your adversary the devil walks about like a roaring lion, seeking whom he may devour:\' 1 Peter 5:8.</p>\n<p>On this particular occasion the assault came like an aerial bombardment.  I say this because there are strong similarities between a spiritual artillery barrage and a natural one.  I have never been in actual combat but, as many of us, I have witnessed the dynamics of long-range shelling in countless movies.  The picture we see has incoming rounds exploding with destructive power; filling the air with smoke and the deafening roar of artillery fire.  There is a general sense of confusion and disorientation as soldiers face a world spiraling out of control.  Keeping our heads during this chaotic period is a big part of winning the battle.</p>\n<h4>Spiritual Parallels</h4>\n<p>Our enemies strategy is simple.  He fires from long range to test the resolve of our defensive positions.  It is an attempt to soften our stand or create a breach in our defensive line.  In this case our defense is our faith.  The central fixture of the Christian armor is the \'Shield of Faith\'.  The shield of faith is the believer\'s primary defensive weapon.  We do not strike with our shields, we protect ourselves when we are being struck.  At this time it would be fruitless to attempt to strike.  This is a time to maintain composure; a time to remember where we are, and who we are.</p>\n<p>In our circumstance the onslaught began just before Christmas.  We were in our typical routine making preparations for the holidays.  Without warning sickness struck the children.  This made our days more complicated than usual.  Just as we seemed to recover, Wendy (my wife) was struck with a sinus infection.  She was virtually bedridden for days.  This of course added one more problem and there was a growing sense of \'being buried\'.  In addition, the children were becoming increasingly unruly.  Nothing overtly bad, they just took twice the normal time to obey.  They forgot things they would not ordinarily forget.  They quarreled more than usual and had difficulty going to and staying asleep.  All of these things in the natural served to distract me from the fact that I had also lost my spiritual bearings--radio contact with headquarters. <br />I am not entirely sure how it happens but the enemy seems to stun us with a glancing blow.  You might say we become \'shell shocked\'.  If you have ever had a heavy blow to the head you know what I\'m talking about.  Your still conscious, but the room seems to move on its own accord.  You know your there, but it feels like your looking at your surroundings from a distance.  Someone is talking to you but their voice echoes strangely; as though resonating through an underground sewer.  Spiritually, the same can happen. <br />Without warning you one day realize that your understanding of spiritual realities is blurred.  Your sense of calling is nowhere in sight; you cannot hear the voice of the Lord; worship is not moving your heart; and in short, you feel very very unworthy.  Two things have happened: The enemy has brought your daily life to a feverish pace to bring weariness, and at the same time, he has directed fiery darts at your faith.  If he succeeds in making you miserable, he will then accuse you of being unfaithful to God and unworthy of any place in the Lord\'s work.  This is where the \'faith\' battle really takes place.</p>\n<h4>Regaining Your Bearings</h4>\n<p>Our first and most crucial step comes with recognizing what is really happening.  No, you are not backsliding!  Yes, you are still saved!  Yes, God is with you!  Remember the casualty the enemy is looking for is a breach in your faith.  He wants to undermine your confident standing in the righteousness of Jesus.  But as long as your shield is intact you cannot be permanently harmed.  You have been dazed by a bomb-shell but you are not dead and your cause is not lost.  Now it is time to stand and hold your ground.  The assault approaching its climax.  Up to this point the enemy has not taken any ground from you.  But, \'has he weakened you enough to gain an opportunity?\'</p>\n<p>It was the day after Christmas when I finally realized the advanced stage of this particular assault.  Looking back it was clear that the previous two weeks had been a spiritual assault.  Just discerning this period was refreshing.  It is as though the shelling had stopped.  The smoke was clearing and there was peaceful silence.  At this very moment the second phase of the enemies attack kicked into full gear.  Realizing he was uncovered, his ground forces charged ahead.  My momentary relief turned to a strange anxiety as the voice of accusation echoed throughout my being. \'What kind of a believer are you?...\' How can you hear from God if you never seek Him?...\' What right have you to expect God will protect you and keep You?...\'  On and on it went.  I was filled with an overwhelming urge to condemn myself.  This was the most dangerous phase of the battle.  Fortunately, the scripture gives us ample warning and instruction.</p>\n<h4>Making a Stand</h4>\n<p>\'Finally, my brethren, be strong in the Lord and in the power of His might.  Put on the whole armor of God that you may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil.  For we do not wrestle against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this age, against spiritual hosts of wickedness in the heavenly places.  Therefore take up the whole armor of God, that you may be able to withstand in the evil day, and having done all, to stand. Stand therefore, having girded your waist with truth, having put on the breastplate of righteousness, and having shod your feet with the preparation of the gospel of peace; above all, taking the shield of faith with which you will be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked one.  And take the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God;...\'(Ephesians 6:10-17)</p>\n<p>Obviously, this is a significant passage when it come to understanding our warfare.  But but no portion is as vital as verse 16.  It begins by isolating a particular piece of armor.  \'Above all, taking the shield of faith with which you will be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked one.\'  All of the other pieces of our armor are important but the shield of faith takes precedence.  Take all the armor but \'above all\' take the shield.  The shield is our defensive weapon against the enemies fiery darts:  His accusing voice.  Faith extinguishes the flame of his rhetoric.</p>\n<p>The rhetoric focuses on the irregular pattern of the last few weeks.  The very nature of the artillery fire has knocked us out of our regular routine.  But this should not suggest failure.  In true warfare, there is no regular routine.  The very nature of battle makes routine almost impossible.  Nevertheless, this is the focus of condemnation.  Happily, the enemy cannot win unless our heart turns from the grace and mercy of Christ.  Our victory is not won by the fact that we have been perfect in word and deed.  Our victory is won by faith.  Our faith declares we stand because He won.  Our faith declares we are worthy, not because we are anything, but because He has loved us and given Himself on our behalf that we should be joint heirs with Him.  In fact faith has its greatest trial and victory in the shadow of human weakness.  Consider Peter as an example of this struggle.</p>\n<h4>Peter\'s Struggle</h4>\n<p>Jesus told Peter that Satan desired to sift him as wheat (Lk 22:31).  In addition to this Jesus went on to say, \'But I have prayed for you, that your faith fail not: and when you are converted, strengthen your brethren.\'  In essence, the enemy was coming to try to destroy Peter.  As it turned out it seemed like Satan had won a victory when Peter denied the Lord.  But that is not where the failure of a man\'s faith occurs.  Here is the pivotal question: When we have fallen short of both our expectations and potential, will our confidence rest in ourselves, or Him who is able to save us?  In other words, does God love us because we have proven ourselves useful and dependable?  No!  God first loved us when we were sinners.  Faith in this truth will prove to be the key to victory.</p>\n<p>Peter denied the Lord three times.  He was the only disciple to boast that he could never do such a thing.  For this very reason it had to happen.  This is not a matter for the enemy alone, the maturing of our faith requires failure where we believe ourselves strong.  In Peter\'s heart there was a line which he never expected to cross.  He secretly held that his value to Jesus rested in his unwavering wholehearted love of Jesus.  This challenge of his faith would do two things.  First Peter would be sifted.  Secondly, his faith would arise stronger and purer.  His confidence in himself would be broken, and his confidence in the love of Jesus would be multiplied.</p>\n<p>One can only imagine the wave of guilt and condemnation Peter suffered.  The shame must have been literally crushing.  Here he had boasted loudly and brashly in front of all the other disciples.  He had openly claimed to be more committed that all of them.  Not only did he feel shame for being a coward, he was humiliated by the fact that his boasting made quiet and secret repentance impossible.  The real test of his faith was yet to come.</p>\n<p>Could his faith overlook his sense of shame and freely receive the forgiving mercy of Christ?  Could he beat back the demonic voices hurling continuous accusations? \'How can you ever follow Christ again?... Nobody will believe a word you will ever speak?... Your nothing but a blowhard and now everyone knows it!... What gives you the right to think you can again be intimate with Jesus and a leader of others!... Why would He want you after this?\'  In this case Peter won.  He did not win because he was perfect.  He won because he faced the shame of his weakness and returned to his place among the eleven.  As the prophet Isaiah declared, \'In returning and rest shall ye be saved; in quietness and in confidence shall be your strength:\'(Isa 30:15).</p>\n<h4>The Truth of Grace</h4>\n<p>At the very heart of faith is the grace and mercy of Christ.  It is easy for mankind to gain a sense of value by the things which he does right.  But the Lord has determined that the pathway of His inheritance will not be human accomplishment.  Otherwise men have reason to boast.  If not human accomplishment, then what?  The answer lies in the accomplishment of Christ.  \'For by grace you have been saved through faith, and that not of yourselves; it is the gift of God,...not of works, lest anyone should boast. (Eph. 2:7-8)  But it is more than that.  For while men are capable, strong and successful there is always room for deception.  Instead God has chosen the weak to confound the strong.  It is after we have seen our weakness, that we will experience the power of His might.</p>\n<p>For this reason we must never despise the battle.  We should never wish the trial of our faith to be done away.  But like Paul, we should glory in our weakness.  We should glory in weakness not for the sake of weakness, but for the sake of faith.  No man can truly say I have believed in grace, until he has seen the end of his strength.  Then, and only then can he say with the deepest conviction, \'I have fought a good fight, I have finished my course, I have kept the faith:\' (2 Tim. 4:7)</p>'),(29,'Recovering Apostolic Authority','<p />There is a model of leadership which can bring us a staggering amount of success.  If we have the aptitude and intelligence to apply the right principles, we will no doubt find ourselves, as it were, \'on top of the heap\'!  But if we expect to recover true Apostolic authority we must journey down another path. It is a path often only partly traveled.  Though most who aspire to responsible leadership are on it; few will follow it to the end.  The Problem?  Apostolic leadership is not a journey up, it is a journey down.  God has chosen\n\nthe weak instead of the strong; the foolish over the wise.  The world has one vision of capable leadership; God has another.  The journey into true spiritual authority is diametrically opposed to conventional thought.  So if we long for the respect of the masses, we cannot help but choose the wrong path.  Make no mistake about it!  The road IS narrow, and few there be that find it.</p>\n<h4>Our Deceptive Hearts</h4>\n<p>My greatest fear in writing this article is because of man\'s \'chameleon like\' heart.  It works like this: Wherever there is a ladder to climb, a position to aspire toward, or influence to wield, I will do what it takes to appear perfect for the job.  It\'s not that we openly conspire to deceive, rather, the heart of man deceives his mind.  The ambition in a man\'s heart will deceive him into playing a part.  He may not believe himself to be anything other than deeply sincere, but after all, that is the nature of deception; we become duped.  By articulating the truth in this article we risk outlining another form; another role for would be actors. I suppose this is to some degree inevitable.  Nevertheless, for those who want to be more than actors I exhort the following: The issue is not about \'what we do\' or \'what we say\', it\'s all about the motivation of our hearts. </p>\n<p>The driving force in man\'s heart is \'ambition\'.  \'We want to succeed, we want to do better, we want to climb to the top.\'  These desires work in so many ways it is not possible to isolate them all.  It is enough to say that ambition is at the very heart of earthly authority, while humility is at the root of Spiritual Authority.  Ambition and humility stand on opposite ends of the court.  We can even make it our goal to avoid ambition, and still be doing it to get ahead.  Just because we can restrain ambition does not mean we are free.  True spiritual authority does not come from stopping ambition.  It comes from a heart trained by the hand of God.  Guarding the issues of the heart is a desirable first step, but it should never suggest an arrival.</p>\n<p>For these reasons we will find two types of people aspiring to spiritual authority.  Some are sincere but carnal.  That is, they love the Lord and want to serve Him, but their hearts are yet filled with ambition.  They cannot see the difference between spirit and soul.  As such, they cannot see much beyond human gifting and charisma.  They are easily impressed by apparent deep devotion, concentrated prayer, and passionate speakers.  These will mature through time, accountable service, and the discipline of the Lord.  The second group are not so; these are corrupt to the core.  They are whisperers and backbiters of whom the Apostles wrote.</p>\n<p>\'These are spots in your love feasts, while they feast without fear, serving only themselves. They are clouds without water,...\', \' wandering stars for whom is reserved the blackness of darkness forever.\'(Jude 12-13) <br />Peter writes concerning them as well. <br />\'By covetousness they will exploit you with deceptive words;\' <br />\'...those who walk according to the flesh in the lust of uncleanness and despise authority. They are presumptuous, self-willed.\'(2 Peter 2:3 & 10)</p>\n<p>This second group are deceivers who are themselves deceived.  Their authority is primarily in the power of their speech.  They have no true authority; they speak \'great swelling words of emptiness\'; exploit the immature.  These are a grave danger to the true sheep.  They are the wolves in the truest sense.  Thankfully they are a small minority.  However their ambition can harness the support of sincere but carnal men.  They rise on a platform of popular opinion and not divine inspiration.  The Apostle Paul\'s battle in Corinth was primarily against these deceivers.  The style of leadership they bring has the appearance of power, but it does not build the kingdom of God.</p>\n<h4>Corinth</h4>\n<p>The Church of Corinth distinguished itself especially in the area of the supernatural.  This made it a prime attraction for both the immature and the deceived to exercise their ambition.  Supernatural power draws the ambitious like a moth to a flame.  You might remember the encounter with the sorcerer in Acts who offered money for divine authority.  Peter responded saying, \'You have neither part nor portion in this matter, for your heart is not right in the sight of God. Repent therefore of this your wickedness, and pray God if perhaps the thought of your heart may be forgiven you.\' (Acts 8:21-22)  This is why Charismatic Churches are often plagued with people of this particular profile.  It is not because the power is wrong; rather, the ambitious are drawn to the exercise of influence of any kind.</p>\n<p>>In the Corinthian Church there was an intense battle for control.  In 1st and 2nd Corinthians Paul reveals two significant things: The spirit of carnal ambition and the humility by which we can identify true spiritual leadership.  His letters were not a term paper or dissertation on the subject, so we wont find a point by point expose.  But sprinkled throughout the epistles we find language clearly underlining the battle between true and false authority.  The central issue surrounds how leadership presents itself, and what motivates it.</p>\n<h4>Viewing Anointed Leadership</h4>\n<p>The Church had become fragmented into various divisive groups, each purporting to follow one or another of the Church leaders.  Each was trying to raise the profile of the person they followed in order to elevate themselves.  Today we can find ourselves doing the same thing.  We may not be so foolish as to declare ourselves the greatest, but we often praise the leader we are most like.  In this round about manner we seek to promote ourselves.  Paul undermines the hierarchy by lifting Christ and demoting the Apostles to servant status.</p>\n<p>\'Who then is Paul, and who is Apollos, but ministers through whom you believed, as the Lord gave to each one? I planted, Apollos watered, but God gave the increase. So then neither he who plants is anything, nor he who waters, but God who gives the increase.\' (1 Cor. 3:5-7)</p>\n<p>Paul flatly states there is no room for any boasting saying, \'We are nothing but people who told you what was told us\'.  We merely passed along what the Lord Jesus gave to us.  Every good thing in us is the product of God, so why should we compete?</p>\n<p>\'For who makes you differ from another? And what do you have that you did not receive? Now if you did indeed receive it, why do you boast as if you had not received it?\'(1 Cor. 4:7)</p>\n<p>Like most deceptions this one is built on perceptions.  Men who covet power and influence revel in making themselves out to be something more than what they really are.  This is the essence of false authority.  The false Apostles worked at creating an aura of mystery, sophistication and power.  So much so that Paul feared \'lest somehow, as the serpent deceived Eve by his craftiness, so your minds(the Corinthians) may be corrupted from the simplicity that is in Christ\'.  The agenda of the false authority is to gain the attention and esteem of men by making themselves seem superior to others. Consider this contrast as you read the following illustration.</p>\n<h4>The Game of Control</h4>\n<p>Imagine a group of several thousand people who find themselves huddled together in some remote barren location.  They are all near starvation until along comes an anonymous benefactor.  He randomly chooses fifty men to follow him down the road until they come to a large truck.  Opening the rear gate he begins to distribute to the fifty as he commissions them to feed the multitude.  The men begin to freely distribute; their hearts run over with gratitude toward the benefactor.  The crowd, unaware of what has happened, see only these men handing out bread.  Some fall at the feet of the distributors thanking them with tears and deep affection.  The men rejoice in the opportunity to bring such joy but declare themselves unworthy of this outpouring of affection.</p>\n<p>Out of this crowd two types of people will begin to emerge.  One group simply wants to help in the distribution.  They see the vast crowd and instinctively know their assistance is needed.  Others however, are more concerned with the people\'s response to the food.  Seeing the gracious flow of love and thanksgiving, their covetous hearts are stirred.  They want to be the objects of this affection; they want this appreciation.  And so they step forward; not to give, but to receive.  As they gain opportunity their hunger for the people\'s affection grows.  In time they devise elaborate strategies for extracting greater amounts of affection.  Some go so far as to create exclusive distributor clubs, compelling \'want-to-be\'s\' to serve them, before giving them a loaf to distribute.  Before long, the labor of love and gratitude becomes a promotional system catering to the ambitions of selfish men.  It was this spirit which the Lord judged in Acts 5. <br />Acts chapter five brings us the story of Ananias and Sapphira.  They rise against the backdrop of rampant benevolence.  People were selling houses and lands, sharing the proceeds with reckless abandon.  Barnabas is specifically mentioned as one who sold land and brought it to the Apostles feet.  Then came the infamous husband and wife team.  They pretended to do the same, deliberately making themselves out to be something they were not.  The reward of their ambition was swift and sudden death.  While we may think them evil, their condition was no worse than what we currently see in the Church.  The harsh judgment was not over their degree of sin, but because of the extent of the Lord\'s power being poured out.  With greater power comes greater accountability.  Today, the withholding of power is for our preservation.  When He pours out more power we will see more judgment.  While we have space, we should pay special attention to the problem of pride and ambition.</p>\n<h4>The Paradox of Power and Weakness</h4>\n<p>Ananias and Sapphira fell because they could not see the humility and brokenness behind the Apostle\'s authority.  The problem with carnal people is that they mistake others as being like themselves.  Since they are filled with ambition, they cannot see others are any different.  When they see power, they can only see \'privilege\'.  They imagine this person is reveling in their authority.  This is where the amazing paradox of Apostolic Authority comes into focus.  The carnal man is hungry for the aura of strength which come with the anointing of the Holy Spirit.  The humble man is only aware of his own need for Jesus to work and minister.  Paul discovered that more power was released when he became aware of his weakness!  The more he saw His own weakness the more the Lord used him.  This again made him hunger to glory in his weakness that the strength of the Lord could show itself.  He saw that the Lord wanted to preserve the dichotomy of strength housed in weakness.  The spiritually immature would do away with weakness to amplify their strength.  But this only brings glory to man.  This was the essence of Paul\'s message to the false Apostles and to those who esteemed them.</p>\n<p>The false Apostles loved to be the focus of people\'s admiration.  And so they made it their lifestyle to appear strong and in command of every situation.  This orientation made weakness something to be despised.  If you were not \'on top and rising\', something must be dreadfully wrong with your faith.  They would ridicule weakness because to their carnal minds it was not compatible with spiritual authority.  To them Paul was disqualified as a true Apostle. (2 Cor. 13:7)  Of course since they themselves had no real authority, they were left with their rhetoric.  This took on two forms: First, they would belittle Paul and what they considered weakness.  Example: \'For his letters, they say, are weighty and powerful, but his bodily presence is weak, and his speech contemptible.\' (2 Cor. 10:10)  Remember, their entire understanding of leadership surrounded a show of strength.  They could not and would not allow themselves to fail or be seen as falling short in any way.  Paul responds by asking the Corinthians, \'Do you look at things according to the outward appearance?\' (vs.7)</p>\n<p>For the record we should note that few things are as revolting as false humility.  People \'acting\' humble are nauseating.  The one caught up in trying to be strong will point to this as a reason for not seeking humility.  This is no excuse! It is like refusing to serve God because of the hypocrites.  Secondly, when it comes to false humility, we should be careful how we judge.  To the carnal mind, all humility is false humility, since it cannot understand what it cannot possess.  False humility is not desireable for obvious reasons.  But neither is true humility.  For true humility is like foolishness to him.  The carnal mind cannot grasp the wisdom of God and so tries to catagorize weakness as failure.  The earthly view of authority cannot accept weakness in any form.  So then, not only did the false Apostles criticize Paul, the boasted in their strength.</p>\n<h4>Self-Promotion</h4>\n<p>The false Apostles used their rhetoric for elevating themselves.  Paul responds saying, \'For not he who commends himself is approved, but whom the Lord commends.\' (2 Cor. 10:18)  In turn he boasts in weakness, \'If I must boast, I will boast in the things which concern my infirmity.\'  And again,\'Therefore I take pleasure in infirmities, in reproaches, in needs, in persecutions, in distresses, for Christ\'s sake.  For when I am weak, then I am strong.\' (2 Cor. 12:10)  This is the height of spiritual wisdom.  There is no hidden mystery, it means exactly what it says.  The natural mind cannot compute this without in some way changing the meaning of what was spoken.  But it can only be understood by revelation.  It came this way to Paul when the Lord said, \'...My strength is made perfect in weakness.\' (2 Cor. 12:9)  Further underlining the pattern of real power Paul refers to the cross saying: <br />\'For though He was crucified in weakness, (not compatible with carnal view of leaders) yet He lives by the power of God. For we also are weak in Him, (same thing) but we shall live with Him by the power of God toward you.\'(2 Cor. 13:4)</p>\n<p>The crucifixion looked like weakness and defeat, but to the spiritual eye it was the secret of victory.  For veiled behind the mask of weakness is the infinite might of Almighty God.  This is the mystery of the Gospel and its power.  Christ in us the hope of glory! In these weak, fragile and very temporal vessels of clay is the \'fullness of God\'.(Eph.3:19)  It is foolishness to try to escape the weakness of the vessel.  This is the genius of God at work!  When we deny the paradox we nullify the mystery.  On the other hand, when we see the mystery we are free to declare our weakness, knowing it does not impede the power of Christ, it releases it. <br />Finally, Paul makes reference to the nonsense of the rhetoric.  He does not have the speaking talent of the false Apostles; nor does he possess the magnetic personality which so impresses the carnal man.  But he underscores the fact that visible strength and powerful oration are not necessarily signs of spiritual authority. \'Even though I am untrained in speech, yet I am not in knowledge.\' (2 Cor. 11:6)  And again, \'For the kingdom of God is not in word but in power.\'(2 Cor. 4:20)  He also reminded them of how he came in weakness, not with \'persuasive words of human wisdom\'. (1 Cor. 2:4)  The Corinthian Church had become overrun by a carnal view of leadership.  They had come to rely on a worldly profile of spiritual leadership.  Today we are dealing with the identical problem, but the time has come for us to change our focus.  Perhaps one final look at the profile of Christ\'s ministry will help us.</p>\n<h4>Looking to Jesus</h4>\n<p>While Jesus could have been born anywhere the Father chose a manger.  Of all the families of Israel He chose an inconsequential portion of David\'s lineage in Joseph and Mary.  While Jerusalem symbolized the height of spiritual significance Bethlehem and Nazareth became His birthplace and hometown.  He had every opportunity to distinguish Himself in the sight of men but instead described himself as \'meek and lowly\'.  He was neither arrogant, presumptuous or driven by a personal agenda.  He lived a simple life of obedience before God never doing or speaking anything without the permission of His Father.  Does this profile match what most of us believe anointed authority is supposed to look like?  Before we begin to clothe ourselves in human glory we should remember Jesus.  \'He has no form or comeliness; and when we see Him, there is no beauty that we should desire Him.  He is despised and rejected by men, a Man of sorrows and acquainted with grief.  And we hid, as it were, our faces from Him; He was despised, and we did not esteem Him.\' (Isaiah 53:2b-3)  God has not changed.  He continues to use what the world considers useless.</p>'),(30,'Rebuilding the Temple','<p />The absence of revelation leaves man in a tenuous circumstance. This is clearly depicted in the building of the second temple. When a group of zealous Hebrews understood the need to build the dwelling place of God, they put their hands to work. Once the foundation was laid, there was both weeping and rejoicing. Those with a partial revelation were satisfied and rejoiced. But those who possessed a wider perspective wept loudly. Today, God is calling for the building of a house. The manner in which we build, and the question of whether we will weep at the works of our hands, hinges on the extent of our revelation. The Lord \n\nis currently calling the Church to a higher place of revelation. If we do not respond, we will find ourselves falling short of His vision, and the works we create will become increasingly secondary in purpose.</p>\n<h4>2nd Temple</h4>\n<p>The occasion of this building surrounds a group of faithful Jews leaving the captivity of Babylon with the edict of King Cyrus. Their goal is to rebuild the temple under the leadership of Zerubbabel. As it happens, they run into some problems from non-Jewish inhabitants, and cease for a time. Then God raises up the prophetic ministries of Haggai and Zechariah, who call the people to complete the task.</p>\n<p>Two significant portions of prophecy emerge which are often quoted today. The first is Zechariah 4:6.<br />\'Not by might nor by power, but by My Spirit, Says the Lord of hosts.\'</p>\n<p>The second is Haggai 2:9.<br />\'\'The glory of this latter temple shall be greater than the former,\' says the Lord of hosts. \'And in this place I will give peace,\' says the Lord of hosts.\'</p>\n<p>These prophetic words spurred them on to complete the building, and provided a spiritual plumb line they actually did not understand. The truth is, neither had their primary application in that day. As it happened they finished the foundation and proceeded to celebrate with great fanfare. However the celebrations were not unanimous. The response from those who had seen the previous temple was wholly different from those who had not.</p>\n<p>\'Then all the people shouted with a great shout, when they praised the Lord, because the foundation of the house of the Lord was laid.But many of the priests and Levites and heads of the fathers; houses, old men who had seen the first temple, wept with a loud voice when the foundation of this temple was laid before their eyes. Yet many shouted aloud for joy,..\' (Ezra 3:11-12)</p>\n<p>Some of the older generation had seen the glory of the first temple and knew instantly that this could not be the prophetic fulfillment of the Haggai\'s prophecy. The workmanship was inferior to the previous temple on many counts, yet the prophecy declared a \'greater than the former\'. So while one group wept, the other rejoiced, though they beheld the very same structure. The difference in their responses hinged on the extent of their revelation. The older generation, having viewed first hand Solomon\'s temple, envisioned something with significantly more splendor. Likewise today we repent with weeping or rejoice with dance at the works of our hands, based on the extent of our revelation.</p>\n<h4>More Lord...</h4>\n<p>If we have truly seen the Lord, we cannot help but weep at the feeble product of human flesh. If we have seen the Lord, we have tasted of the desire of His heart and long for what will please him. We cannot be comforted by cheap imitations or dwell in the solace that \'at least it is better than what others have\'. Instead, we are driven by faith and expectation to something higher and better. We repent at our weakness and turn our hearts with humility toward Him.</p>\n<p>Such repentance should not be misinterpreted as discouragement. Rather, it is posture of the meek which prepares them to see God. The mistake we often make is one of reckless presumption. We need to come to a place of clear perspective if we hope to truly participate in building for God. Consider for a moment the way a father trains a son. If for example, the father is building a house, he begins by imparting the basic skills. He will teach his son how to swing a hammer and hit a nail. And so he give him a plastic hammer, some wooden pegs, and a piece of wood with holes in it. At this point the child is unaware that he is unable to be truly productive. Though proud of his work, it is, in effect, entirely without practical merit.</p>\n<p>Today much of the Church finds itself in this place. The Lord has, in effect, given us toys to practice with. However, we are often unable to distinguish between the labor we are doing, and what is required to cross the threshold of usefulness. Even when it comes time to swing a real hammer, we are still not ready for serious work. How many fathers have been gifted with pieces of boards, uneven and out of square, riddled with a combination of bent and randomly placed nails. We value these things not because they are truly useful but because they speak of an intention to please and serve. Thus, much of what we do has limited value.</p>\n<p>Of course, there is no condemnation in being immature or in a place of limited power to contribute. What can become a problem is an unwillingness to grow past this point. While it is natural to temporarily esteem what we produce in infancy, it is unnatural to remain there. How many authors look upon their very first article with pride and fondness? Rather, as our appreciation of \'perfection\' grows, so does are estimation of what is worth keeping. This is the nature of our training in the Lord.</p>\n<h4>From Glory to Glory</h4>\n<p>The journey God is taking us on is prophetically described as \'from glory to glory\' (1 Corinthians 3:18). Each level becomes appreciably higher and better than the previous. Each level provides the Lord a better and better working substance with which to build His house. On our side, we simply have to be willing to grow past those things we have produced in the past and reach for what lies ahead. Still it is not easy for a boy to trash a \'work of art\'.</p>\n<p>The writer of Hebrews brought a similar challenge to first century believers who became mired in the past. He told them they should be further along, and measured that progress by their ability to discern between good and evil.</p>\n<p>\'For though by this time you ought to be teachers, you need someone to teach you again the first principles of the oracles of God, and you have come to need milk and not solid food. For everyone who partakes only of milk is unskilled in the word of righteousness, for he is a babe. For solid food belongs to those who are of full age, that is, those who by reason of use have their senses exercised to discern both good and evil.\' (Hebrews 5:12-14)</p>\n<p>This passage actually says more than we can deal with. But what we want to focus on is the ability to discern between good and evil. This is not to be confused with the \'knowledge of good and evil\' from the garden. Rather it is good in the sense of being esteemed worthy of use by God. He is the master builder who determines what is worthy and what is substandard. To be useful today, our revelation must become aligned to His. We must allow the master builder to challenge, mold, and form our sense of what is useable and what is not. If we do not, we will find ourselves treasuring what is not a treasure to Him.</p>\n<p>The response to this training will always include a phase of repentance. It emerges the moment we discover our value system has been out of sync with His. Those who do not respond will continue on, perhaps never realizing their efforts are in vain. Those who are satisfied with the 2nd temple can not lay hold of God\'s vision for a latter house exceeding in glory. Instead, they are satisfied with their labor. They cannot appreciate the call for something better because they cannot see it, or are unwilling to see it. But those who see are not so easily consoled. They weep, lament and seek that missing portion. Their weeping is more than remorse. It is a reaching past themselves for a grace that would yet come.</p>\n<p>Their repentance is a laying down what was previously sufficient. It is not an act of unbelief; rather, it is a supreme and profound act of faith. Having seen with the eye of faith what the Spirit of God intends, we respond by grieving over our own works. Then, in brokenness, we hear the words they also heard: \'Not by might nor by power, but by My Spirit, Says the Lord of hosts.\' We hear the promise of a house whose glory will exceed the latter. It gives Life to our faith, while at the same time, it is the sword of death to human strength and righteousness. Then, out of the ashes of another encounter with the Living God, we rise to venture anew. Another level, a purer standard, and a fresh expectation move us on from glory to glory. Again we lay our hands to the plow, knowing He will look upon the labor of His soul and be satisfied (Isaiah 53:11).</p>'),(31,'Purity Before Freedom','<p />The religious spirit comes as an angel of light.  It pretends to be wisdom from above.  In reality, it purposes to stifle, suppress and suffocate the true expressions of the Holy Spirit.  Using man?s fear of the unknown it goads believers into a place of suspicion and unbelief.  Whether the issue is tongues, the renewal, or worship, the enemy is always at work.  But like any thief he leaves his mark, making him easier to spot.  You just need to know his modus operandi (mode of operation).  The attack is simple and can be identified as the pursuit of purity without the benefit of freedom.  Pretending to stand for purity, it withholds freedom while feigning a search for the ?right? way. This is the mark of a darkened wisdom.  It presents a form of spirituality but lacks critical \n\nsubstance.  In the end it leaves a hollow shell of tradition without the Life.  The Holy Spirit on the other hand works by the rule of another paradigm. He first gives freedom before any mention of purity.</p> \n<h4>The Courage of Faith</h4>\n<p>Whenever a group of people makes a leap forward in the things of the Spirit there are always roadblocks and would-be detractors.  We have certainly seen this regarding expressions of worship and the activity of the Holy Spirit.  There is always someone there to protest when someone else steps out.  Navigating these roadblocks is a matter of faith and divine wisdom. </p>\n<p>Divine wisdom is essential because whenever we venture in faith, fear and unbelief make an argument.   Divine wisdom is a specific portion of the ?knowledge of God? that renders that argument powerless.  Dismantling the enemy?s pseudo wisdom is a key goal in the journey.  Thankfully divine wisdom is our powerful ally for pulling down strongholds!  On the other hand without divine wisdom, these arguments have the appearance of sound counsel.</p>\n<p>Faith is critical!  It releases us into the breadth of God?s provision.  Faith is the light that leads us down the darkened alley of our ignorance.  It enables us to rely on the Spirit?s power to lead us into all truth.  It is faith that enables us to confidently do what no one has previously done.  Whether we speak of Moses, Noah or Abraham, all are equally commended for the same thing. They followed the Lord in doing what was not previously done.  God spoke, they heard and obeyed.  To do what is regularly done does not require much faith at all.  And so the scripture contrasts walking by sight as opposed to faith. </p>\n<p>Once you spend a little time in the church you will find that people in general have difficulty doing something new.  If someone dances where no one previously danced someone will struggle.  If you raise your hands in a church where no one raises their hands, people will become uncomfortable.  The truth is that it is far easier to do what is already being done and keep it there.  Unfortunately too many lives reflect this approach.  This, of course, is because much of the modern church is ruled by a sentimental attachment to traditional Christianity.  We call it faith but it is truly nothing, and I mean NOTHING in the strongest possible way.  <br />For many, the Christian faith has been received as a part of the culture of the day.  We absorb it as we would music, art and fashion. There is a capacity to embrace what is safe but an inability to passionately propel oneself into raw obedience.  Launching into uncertainty is not even remotely possible.  Whereas the essence of true faith is that it allows you to walk on water.  Without it we are confined to terra firma, only those things which are widely accepted as a part of traditional faith.  On the other hand true faith releases you from the tyranny of the present to navigate into the unseen realm.</p>\n<h4>Do Not Fear Error!</h4>\n<p>When I first came to the Lord my mother gave me the most powerful guidelines for Christian living.  She told me not to fear error.  She said that the devil is cleverer than me and that I had no hope of ever discovering all the possible pitfalls he might produce ? that through the ages of church history he had deceived men who were by far my superiors in every way.  In essence she directed me to set my eyes on Jesus and the promise of the Spirit.  Jesus said He would send us the Holy Spirit and that the Holy Spirit would lead us into all truth.<br />What I came to believe at that moment was that I was entirely dependant upon the Holy Spirit in the arena of truth.  Furthermore, I discovered that the fear of error fuels a spirit of deception.  Subsequently the Lord repeatedly challenged me with Proverbs 3:5.<br />?Trust in the Lord with all your heart, and lean not on your own understanding.?</p>\n<p>To trust in the Lord with all my heart is pitted against the things I presently understand to be true.  This means that nothing I have come to understand in the past can guarantee passage through what is yet to come.  Today, with many revelations under my belt, I can safely say I do not know what I do not know.  When I come to know a thing that I did not know, I then recognize that in fact, ?I did not know that?.  This may seem elementary, but it is the foundation on which all our lives should be built.  Living in the light of this truth keeps us in a place of weakness and dependency.  The more often we are surprised at our ignorance the easier it is to abandon trust in our current knowledge.  This is not to say that I abandon what I already know, but rather that I cannot trust in it.  It is incomplete!</p>\n<p>My mother?s advice concluded with a warning and a commission.  She said, ?Wherever you see the evidence of the Spirit of God jump in with both feet, but beware?? she added, ?that many will come around you and caution you to withdraw.  Having an appearance of wisdom they will point to excesses and flesh?.  This happened precisely as predicted.  But what I learned is that there will always be excesses and flesh as long as people are involved.  The human side of the equation will always appear in both those are quick to advance and those who will not. </p>\n<p>And so my advice is the same to other believers.   The Holy Spirit is given to lead you into all truth, so believe Him.  Do not trust your intellectual abilities to deduce truth, look for the witness of the Spirit.  And yet remember that the truth you discover in your personal walk will always be consistent with the Word of God.  That is, the Holy Spirit will not tell you to steal, murder or divorce your wife.  And so we need not fear error but be aware of what is expressly forbidden.</p>\n<h4>Wisdom?</h4>\n<p>In addition to faith we need divine wisdom.  In this present age wisdom is as beauty, it is found in the eye of the beholder.  In other words when someone has a particular belief he will identify wisdom according to his present perceptions.  If someone is racist then the rhetoric of racism will strike him as wisdom.  Likewise when there is fear and unbelief in our hearts, its rhetoric will have the ring of wisdom.</p>\n<p>In the early days of my walk I came to see this with great regularity.  I happened to be part of a Bible College that was adventurous in the Spirit.  When no one else was dancing, they were dancing.  When deliverance was controversial, they were casting out demons in the name of Jesus.  Unfortunately not everyone was comfortable with these fresh expressions.   One of the schools professors struggled with expressions of worship and most particularly dancing.  He would argue that those who did favor the gifts of the Holy Spirit were not stumbling over the Spirit Himself but over our dancing.  The idea being, that if our dancing contained more purity, then they would not stumble.  If there were less human emotions then perhaps the evidence of the Holy Spirit would come through.  This is utter nonsense!  But it is the substance of many accusations and the basis of much fear. </p>\n<p>This category of arguments is a veil behind which hides an unbelieving heart.  Some use it as an excuse for not living according to the truth already evident to them.  In other words ?I do not go to Church or participate in Christianity because there are hypocrites there?.  Yet, these same people will still participate in a sports team and work at a job where other forms of hypocrisy prevail.  The failure of people cannot invalidate the truth.  If we are truly committed to the truth, what others do is immaterial.  You cannot justify not prophesying because others do it wrong.  The fact that one believer does something imperfectly does not justify our abandoning it entirely.  This argument has an appearance of wisdom but it is a lie.</p>\n<p>Recently this lie has resurfaced with regards to renewal manifestations.  It goes something like this:  ?I am fine with the Holy Spirit and manifestations so long as they are purely God?.  Others have said this in regards to prophecy and dance, yet they themselves participate in neither.  How is it that those who don?t dance or prophesy become the judges of those who make every effort.  In the natural, what person would respect the opinion of a hockey commentator who had no firsthand experience and who regularly misinterpreted the rules?  They say they are for a purer version of the things they reject, but show no capacity, desire or intent to walk in them.  Instead, they sit idly waiting for some version that meets their criteria.  It will not come!<br />The false wisdom behind this argument suggests that it sides with purity.  ?When you do it right (according to me), then I will approve of what you are doing.?  In other words, once an indescribable level of perfection is achieved then freedom and endorsement is granted.  The problem with this demonic wisdom is the belief that you can have purity without freedom.  This wisdom says, ?you can dance if, and only if, it is in the spirit.?  ?You can prophesy, but only if there are never any mistakes.  We believe in manifestations but only if they are void of human emotion and any evidence of flesh.?  Those who say such things may sincerely believe they are standing for ?pure? streams but they do not.  They are those who not only do not enter, they refuse entry to others.  Sincerity aside, they are deceived by their own unbelief and fear.  The religious leaders of Jesus? day believed they were contending against that which would undermine a true expression of God.  They were wrong!</p>\n<p>Imagine a mother telling her nine-month-old son that he could not ?attempt? to walk.  ?Unless you do it right you cannot do it at all!?  Imagine a whole society taking this approach.  ?In order to protect the sanctity of ?walking?, we forbid wrong walking.  No stumbling or falling is acceptable.  We will only tolerate what is being done with purity.  What would be the outcome?  First off, the next generation would never walk.  They would spend their days living in the shadow of those who once walked, revering their memory and example.  Saying with suitable emotion, ?We remember with fondness our fathers who once walked.  We celebrate the place where they walked and we enshrine their footsteps.  On account of their pure walking we discourage walking which lacks the spirit of their excellent example.?</p>\n<p>If this strikes you as ludicrous you are right.  But this wisdom prevails in many circles. If we embraced this wisdom, ?walking? would disappear from our experience in the same way the activity of the Spirit has waned from many churches.  That is, until someone was willing to step out, and risk doing it wrong, until it was right.  Where courage is absent, the ministry of the Spirit has gradually departed.</p>\n<h4>Divine Wisdom</h4>\n<p>We do not suggest that we abandon wisdom, but there is a way that seems right to man whose end is death.  The question we might ask ourselves is ?where is the dividing line between wisdom and unbelief??  Can anyone suffering under the weight of fear ever hope to make that distinction?  Unbelief and a religious spirit continuously point to the failure and excess of some to discourage others.  However we need not abandon our love of purity to encourage freedom.  If you want someone to sing who is afraid of doing it wrong, the first step is to simply get him or her singing.  Once they have begun to make that necessary initial venture, then you gradually integrate the requirement of purity.  To demand purity without first giving freedom will only lead to one outcome.  Fear and unbelief will dictate all future ministry.  The pattern of the kingdom of heaven is based on the mercy heart of God.  Freedom is always given before purity is demanded.  It is in this atmosphere that natural children develop.  Can any wisdom say it would be any different for spiritual children?</p>'),(32,'Overcoming the Religious Spirit - I','<p>For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this age, against spiritual hosts of wickedness in the heavenly places.\' (Ephesians 6:12)\n<p>The Church is currently waging a winning war against a host of spiritual forces.  Jesus promised we will win this battle and that the \'gates of hell\' will not prevail against us.  One of the most important strongholds we will overcome will be the Religious Spirit.  A key strategy which must be used in spiritual warfare is battling in the realm of \'arguments\'.  Understanding the way which this spirit gains a position of influence is an important first step.</p>\n\n<h4>A Common Stronghold</h4>\n<p>Scripture informs us that our enemy gains access to our lives by the power of \'arguments\' or \'knowledge\'.  That is, he is empowered by our own entrenched ways of thinking.  When we think as he does, the place of that agreement is where he can work.  This is one definition of a stronghold! Jesus once said \'The Prince of this world is coming but He has nothing in me\'.  Paul exhorted that we give \'no place\' to the devil.  The enemies authority is not inherent to himself, but resides in what we give him.</p>\n<p>The truth is the world is ruled by ideas.  And those ideas have their genesis in either the Kingdom of God or the Kingdom of Darkness.  Whether those ideas are political or spiritual, the author of the idea becomes the head of the one who holds it.  Meaning, when the ideas we hold to originate from the father of lies, he obtains a degree of influence over us.  Freedom from the enemy begins with being free from his knowledge which is described as being against or contrary to the knowledge of God (2 Corinthians 10:3-4).  <br />\'For the weapons of our warfare are not carnal but mighty in God for pulling down strongholds, casting down arguments and every high thing that exalts itself against the knowledge of God, bringing every thought into captivity to the obedience of Christ.\' </p>\n<p>The battle between the two kingdoms is a battle of knowledge, one of which is God\'s.  The weaponry of the Kingdom pulls down arguments which are contrary to the knowledge of God.  The Kingdom of God advances as truth is expressed in the communication of the knowledge of God. This of course is not done through mere thoughts or words but by the spirit of revelation.</p>\n<p>The goal of preaching and teaching is to dislodge worldly philosophies and perspectives from people\'s minds. The way we will win over the religious spirit is by destroying the stronghold - knowledge - on which it sits. As Jesus said, \'You will know the truth and the truth shall make you free\' (John 8:32).</p>\n<p>The difficulty is we are usually unaware of how our knowledge may agree with our enemy\'s.  That is, we can be influenced by a philosophy and not really know it as our own.  Yet, today\'s greatest spiritual strongholds are connected to the most common and popular understandings of our time. And though they are widely held views, they may not be written about or directly referred to in conversations.  One of those is as follows.</p>\n<h4>The Strong & the Weak</h4>\n<p>It believes there are two general classifications of people - the \'weak\' and the \'strong\', also known as the \'good\' and the \'bad\'.  The strong and the successful are admired and envied, while the weak are held in secret contempt..  It is considered \'good\' to be strong - \'bad\' to be weak. </p>\n<p>The weak are often pitied and rarely honored.  Unless of course giving sympathy to the weak is a part of society\'s equation for being \'good\' and \'strong\'.  The weak are downtrodden, fearful and timid. They generally do not do well in life.  Anything they have achieved, though it may be insignificant, is vigorously guarded. </p>\n<p>The strong usually do much better; they are upbeat, positive, outgoing and adventurist types. Gifted as they are strong, they naturally rise to the top in every sphere of life.  They are proud of their accomplishments and will often feel morally superior to the struggling hoards who want to be like them.  They will often be perceived as the \'good people\' since a part of their success depends on widespread approval.  The more this is the case the better they will work on appearing so.</p>\n<p>The struggling class is said to battle \'low self-esteem\'.  They do not feel as good about themselves as the strong.  These are often disadvantaged in modern society.  They may belong to a visible minority, come from a broken home or for some reason lack proper education.  Their critics would say they are lazy, without ambition and do not have the moral willpower to better themselves. Others might say they lack pride in themselves. </p>\n<p>Because of these and other factors the \'weak\' tend to gravitate toward various self-destructive behaviors including crime and drugs.  This of course adds to the notion of their being on the \'bad\' end of societies \'good and bad\' scale.  In the final analysis success in society is largely equated with \'good\' and failure with \'bad\'.</p>\n<p>Partially for this reason, men like Anthony Robbins rise to greater heights of success by teaching the so-called \'weak\' how to become \'strong\'. He and others have developed seminars and tools whereby everyone can learn to be \'on top\'. A significant key in the process, besides adopting \'winning\' lifestyle habits, is the need to believe in yourself. The outcome is programs designed to ignite a sense of confidence in oneself. A \'you can do it\' mentality. Many social programs build around this model in order to make people more functional, or in other words \'good\'.</p>\n<p>While this may be a crude outline it is pretty much how people see themselves and others.  But this is a \'knowledge\' to which the Lord does not ascribe.  Furthermore, it is the stronghold of the Religious Spirit.  It is a ruling \'knowledge\' by which men determine who is \'good\' and who is \'bad\'; who is worth knowing and who is not.  Since most covet to be a part of the \'strong\', society begins to fragment.  Men accentuate the value of their particular strength to the neglect of others in order to ascend the ladder of achievement.  Soon a plethora of interest groups rise, each with their own behavior codes and cultures.  Now even criminals have a moral code by which they measure themselves amongst themselves. </p>\n<p>Clearly it is all foolishness.  Man\'s understanding of good and evil is seriously misguided and is at the heart of the problem presently facing the Church.  It is the very understanding which empowered the Religious Spirit in Christ\'s day and continues to fuel it now.  It is rooted in the presumption that men can be good.  This presumption has become the source of motivation behind human achievement (Humanism), the Religion of the secular world.  To the delight of the \'weak\' common man, Jesus came to destroy it all.</p>\n<h4>God\'s View</h4>\n<p>The Father sent Jesus to destroy the works of the evil one (1 John 3:8).  He did that by preaching the gospel which revealed the righteousness of God (Romans 1:17).  Righteousness of course being closely related to the \'goodness of God\'.  If men could see His righteousness they would immediately distance themselves from their own . \'...not knowing it is the goodness of God which leads you to repentance.\' (Romans 2:4)  Hence the Gospel of Jesus begins with a very important premise, often missed in today\'s preaching. It declares \'There is none good, no not one\' (Romans 3:12) </p>\n<p>To Jesus there are no winners and losers, good and evil, only a race of men lost in sin and headed for damnation. This is the message Jesus came to declare; that all men were shut up in sin. Every means men have devised to make themselves feel good are illegitimate. He said, \'I am the way the truth and the Life, no one comes to the Father but by ME\' (John 14:6).  The preaching of the gospel of Jesus Christ marks the end of every system of judgment other than His own, which concluded all men to be evil and utterly condemned. </p>\n<p>Whether you are a dedicated doctor concerned about your duty as a human being, or a convicted murderer, both are in the exact same condition. God has Himself has determined the dividing line between \'good and evil\'. In His estimation, the best of the best still do not make the grade. </p>\n<p>To the degree we struggle with this truth we are vulnerable to the Religious Spirit. This is why the Pharisees stumbled, they were bound by the Religious Spirit. Jesus came with a very simple message, saying all had sinned and fallen short. In essence He came to demolish the class system as described above. Not to elevate the evil but to humble the \'good\'. It was not the so called sinners who stumbled, it was the religious leaders. Those who were gifted strong and morally advantaged were deeply offended by this truth. Yet , Jesus stood unwavering in His conviction.</p>\n<h4>The Two Trees</h4>\n<p>The deception as we can see is widespread influencing every sector of society. But just where did it begin? It was in the garden of Eden at the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. Against the Lord\'s command Adam and Eve ate of that tree. Something happened from which mankind has never been able to escape. They obtained a capacity to divide between good and evil. However at the same time they lost the ultimate measure of good: God Himself!</p>\n<p>To this point Adam had free access to God\'s presence as they walked in the garden together. Adam likely did not understand it, but God was the embodiment of Life and \'all good\'. Without the knowledge of God, Adam could never know true good from true evil. Without the freedom to interact with the Lord as before, mankind was now in darkness concerning actual \'righteousness\'. </p>\n<p>Mankind would continue to possess the power to decide good from evil, but without the benefit of a true standard. Now he was left to devise his own idea of \'good\'. \'Good\' became what men decided it was, and every man did what was right in his own eyes. The outcome is a perception of \'good\' without a true \'knowledge of good\'. </p>\n<p>The authority of the Religious Spirit is built on this warped understanding of good and evil. The mechanism by which men have come to determine what is right is deeply flawed. Jesus said, \'If therefore the light that is in you is darkness, how great is that darkness!\' (Matthew 6:23) Essentially saying, \'If the method you use to determine what is good is itself corrupted by evil, you will produce nothing but evil and who knows how great that evil is\'. It was not so much a question as it was a statement! The point being, when the blind are leading the blind neither of them know where they are, where they have been, or where they are going.  <br />To illustrate this a little further consider the world of aviation. If you are flying without sight and you discover your instrumentation has malfunctioned, \'Where are you?\' Until you can measure with something which works you will never know. Navigation depends on fixed points! You need to start from a true point or else you will never arrive at the desired destination.</p>\n<p>This is the Gospel of Jesus. He said \'I am the light of the world: he that follows me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life\'(John 8:32). He came to correct the course of mankind. But He cannot help us unless we first concede our own sense of \'good and evil\' to be flawed. Neither can He continue to help us unless we continue to use His system. But that system could not be another set of rules but the Lord Himself. The only way we can know \'good\' from \'evil\' is to know Him.</p>\n<h4>Conclusion</h4>\n<p>The revelation of Jesus is not only the answer to our sin problem, it is also the remedy against the power of the Religious Spirit. The power of the Religious Spirit works within darkness; that darkness is the deception which says \'man can be good\'. When we are fully convinced that we can do nothing of ourselves we will be completely free. So long as there is any hidden sense of self-righteousness the Religious Spirit will continue to have a foothold in our lives.</p>'),(33,'Overcoming the Religious Spirit - II','<p>The Church has had to deal with Fear and Pride.  They are two of our most daunting enemies.  Historically, they have worked in tandem, dividing the Church by creating extremes.  In one respect they have nothing in common since they possess characteristics which are mutually exclusive -- ie. pride is arrogant and forward whereas fear is timid.  Yet, if the truth be known, they are actually the hands and feet of another more cunning spirit.  They are the chief emissaries of the Religious Spirit.  Fear and Pride form the vanguard of the Religious Spirit\'s divisive strategy against the Body of Christ. Unfortunately, our ignorance of this fact has given it a tremendous corridor from which to operate.  It is time for this veil of ignorance to be lifted! </p>\n<h4>Superficial Discernment </h4>\n<p>Most believers have little idea how the Religious Spirit really works.  We know it comes to displace the living experience of faith and is a counterfeit of true Christianity.  However we generally do not have the means of isolating and identifying it.  Instead we are content to have a superficial view of it\'s nature and characteristics, which we suppose is the same as actually knowing it.  </p>\n<p>Generally, we view \'religious people\' as those prone to embrace tradition and ritual.  While this can be true it is not necessarily so.  Many Anglican Churches, which are considered a more traditional expression of the Body of Christ, demonstrate as much or more evidence of life than Pentecostal and Charismatic assemblies.  And while it may be the case that traditionalism and the Religious Spirit most often go hand in hand, it\'s actual influence reaches much further.  How far that influence extends is an issue to which we should be giving careful attention. </p>\n<p>If the truth were known, many who boast about being current, relevant and vital are rapidly becoming the next generation of pharisees.  While in the midst of guarding against tradition and ritual, they mistakenly pattern themselves by another tradition.  The only difference is that their new tradition has no history.  While it may be \'new\', the question we should be asking is:  Is it Spirit and Life?  It is a mistake to think because the culture of my church is newer and \'not like the one I grew up in\', it is therefore not \'religious\'.  <br />The prophet Hosea said, \'my people are destroyed for a lack of knowledge\' (Hosea 4:6).  It is what we do not know which becomes a snare to us.  No believer ever purposely made it their goal to become a New Testament Pharisee.  When it happens, it is without our active consent.  The essence of being \'deceived\' includes being completely unaware of one\'s condition.  Victims are taken captive because they are \'ignorant of his devices\'(2 Corinthians 2:11).  They simply walked out their life as best they knew until, to the dismay of a younger zealous generation, they were found resisting what the spirit was doing.  </p>\n<p>This pattern, wherein the proponents of one move of God will persecute the next, has been present in the Church for generations.  It exists primarily because of the influence of the Religious Spirit.  If history repeats itself, the current generation of passionate seekers, of which you and I are a part, will persecute the next generation.  That is, unless something is changed.  To avoid a similar fate we must discover what creates these conditions.  I believe the answer is found in overcoming the two key tentacles of the Religious Spirit: Fear and Pride!  </p>\n<h2>Fear and Pride </h2>\n<p>It is not likely any of us wish to become a fearful and territorial bunch of religious bigots.  The problem is, it is easier than we imagined and there is more than one way to get there. If you want to go to Australia you can take a direct route.  On the other hand, if you want to try to get as far from Australia as possible, you can head in the opposite direction.  Either way, at some point you will find yourself in Australia.  There are also two paths to \'religious control\' - one is direct the other is the long way. </p>\n<p>Within the flesh of each believer is a bent toward either the need for security or the desire for ambition.  These two drives coincide with fear and pride.  If fear is not a major issue then ambition will be.  However, both fear and pride are directly opposite to faith, making them the common enemy of true Christianity.  Fear is a condition of dependence on self which leads us to seek for security.  Pride is dependence on self leading to self-glory.  Each of these represent an avenue by which we can be deceived and taken captive of the Religious Spirit. </p>\n<p>The path of the fearful is the most easily identified.  When we become schooled in a fear based, intellectual and powerless system we cannot help but become spiritually stagnant - \'having a form of godliness but denying the power thereof\' (2 Timothy 3:5).  Our sympathies quickly turn away from the Lord onto the organization within which we find ourselves.  The need for security becomes a key issue leading us to become conservative in our approach to faith and ministry.  Security is found within the \'company\'.  We shy away from anything extreme preferring to promote what is mainstream.  Why?  Because it is safe and there is less chance of jeopardizing our future. Those who follow this path will easily become classic victims of a Religious Spirit.  This is the direct path!  However, there is another more insidious pathway to religious bigotry.  </p>\n<p>It begins with the adventurit, fearless, go-forward at any cost, \'grab everything God has\' kind of attitude, present in those who are zealous.  Typically, the zealous are quick to identify the shortcomings of the fearful.  Consequently, they easily pick up a cocky arrogance about not being \'religious\'.  It manifests in a subtle or pronounced disdain for more traditional believers.  Accompanying this is an appetite for what is new and fresh; a passion for what is particularly \'untraditional\'.  Special attention is paid to being \'unlike\' the fearful.  Without realizing it, they have boarded the same train as the fearful, headed for destination \'religious\'.  While they may not ride in the car of \'security\' they have boarded the one called \'ambition\'. </p>\n<h4>The Error of Presumption </h4>\n<p>The key error is presumption!  Presuming to know how to identify the features of a religious spirit, the zealous emphatically pursue the opposite.  Unfortunately, as we shall discover, the opposite is also the domain of the Religious Spirit - a mirror image of the same thing.  The strategy of the Religious Spirit is to create two camps under it\'s control.  By keeping these two parts segregated and actively opposing one another, they perhaps will never wake up to the reality that their condition, while apparently contrary, is identical. <br />Jesus told us not to judge after the flesh but to judge with righteous judgment.  Paul wisely wrote \'...some men\'s sins are clearly evident, preceding them to judgment, but those of some men follow later\' (1 Timothy 5:24).  We can be critical of another while being guilty of the identical sin, only to discover the truth at the judgment seat of Christ.  </p>\n<p>This is certainly true with selfishness, for example.  Though we are equally infected by the fall, it is not uniformly visible in all.  Some cleverly disguise their ambitions.  Like everyone else they are selfish, yet they know the power found in accommodating others.  While they are no less committed to their own end than others, they skillfully achieve their goals without most people realizing who was responsible.  To the naked eye it does not look like selfishness, but it is worse as it opens the door to forms of deception bordering on witchcraft.  </p>\n<h4>What is Freedom? </h4>\n<p>Similarly, being \'religious\' has little to do with what we look like on the outside, it is a matter of the heart.  Jeremiah wrote, \'The heart is deceitful above all things, and desperately wicked; who can know it?\' (Jeremiah 17:9).  One can easily be victim to the Religious Spirit without ever realizing.  Perhaps that is because we do not fully understand what it means to be free.  Then again, maybe we should be asking ourselves the reverse question:  What does it mean to be bound?  Simply stated, to be in bondage means we are unable to be ourselves; that somehow we are manipulated, goaded or coerced by an outside force.  This can happen with or without our knowledge. </p>\n<p>Take Canadians for an example.  From time to time in our country we exhibit an anti-american sentiment.  It is somewhat like the envy a younger brother experiences over an older sibling.  In Canada it surfaces as an attempt to escape the tremendous influence the United States has on the Canadian way of life.  Strangely enough however, every attempt to do so means that being Canadian becomes synonymous with everything which is not American.  Ironically then, any attempt to not be influenced means we must continue to define ourselves by what they are not.  Since we are trying to be what they are not, our orientation remains subject to who and what they are.  This is not freedom, it is a perceived freedom.  If we were truly free, we would never feel the need to define ourselves by what others are or are not. </p>\n<p>Likewise, if one was actually free from the influence of a religious spirit it would never be important to \'not look religious\'.  The presence of this disposition is in itself the evidence of the Religious Spirit\'s influence.  This might be a shock to those who are carefully avoiding being religious!  Our thinking is that since we do not talk, dress or present ourselves like traditional \'religious\' people, we assume we are free.  This assumption is dangerous and is a mask behind which demonic influence hides.  This issue goes far beyond how we dress.  It includes the style of our worship; the content of our Christian vocabulary; the style of preaching and teaching we endorse; the version of Bible we use (and our attitude toward those who use other versions); how we name our Churches and on and on.  It is a profound presumption to think that absorbing the most contemporary mannerisms is the evidence of not being religious.  How long will it take before a generation of the church really comes to believe and understand the scripture which says, \'For the kingdom of God is not eating and drinking, but righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Spirit.\' (Romans 14:17) </p>\n<p>The Religious Spirit comes to counterfeit Christianity.  It is concerned with \'eating and drinking\', meaning it is oriented around externals.  It seeks to involve man in activities which have an appearance of good but have no connection to a \'living faith\'.  It is neither the \'wearing\' or the \'not wearing\' of a suit which counts.  So long as we are distracted by issues which are natural, the development of true faith, which centers on what is \'spirit\', will be hindered.  </p>\n<p>But beyond this, how can we know whether we are still being influenced?  Is there a test by which we can measure ourselves?  While no \'test\' is foolproof (especially when we are the ones administering it) there is a way to at least partially check ourselves.  We can know we are not yet free when we are able to classify others by the way they dress, the church they attend, the nature of their vocabulary, which version of the Bible they use, or how they wear their hair.  He who is truly spiritual as opposed to religious, is one who \'regards no one according to the flesh\' (2 Corinthians 5:16).  If any of the above factors influence your capacity to enjoy the fellowship of others, you are still at least partially bound by the Religious Spirit. </p>\n<h4>In Conclusion </h4>\n<p>There are several ways to consider this teaching.  Clearly it can help us to accept others in our own churches who are unlike ourselves.  Beyond that we can become reconciled to other congregations and fellowships.  Finally, it may help us to bridge the great gulf of division separating the Body of Christ - the one end of the spectrum called Conservative and the other Charismatic.  The term Charismatic is being used loosely to include Pentecostals, Word of Faith and Vineyard, in addition to all those churches which would identify themselves as specifically Charismatic.  Charismatics have long identified and lamented the problem of fear within the conservative elements of the church.  While this is indeed a problem which has kept Conservatives from embracing Charismatics, Charismatics also become the victims of the divisive power we call the Religious Spirit.  <br />It is evident not by fear so much as by an arrogant pride present in many Charismatic circles. It manifests in the ease by which we classify others as being unlike ourselves and therefore lesser.  Of course no one would ever permit themselves to speak openly in these terms, but this attitude prevails.  It is also unlikely many have seen this as pride. It is however a burdensome stone to the Holy Spirit.  Nevertheless, this is the present condition of the Church:  Two factions standing at opposing poles; one bound by fear, the other by pride,.. both victims of the Religious Spirit.  Our freedom will be found in the loving grace of the God of All Mercy, as we cry out to Him in repentance for our part. </p>'),(34,'Overcoming Deferred Hope','<p>Faith requires standing and believing for a promise without receiving it.  Yet, the scripture tells us deferred hope makes the heart sick.  Can we expect to not have a ?sick heart? when promises are delayed?  If not, how then can we expect to maintain joy during the time of delay?  The truth is we can live in complete joy and victory and still never receive our promise.  There is a place we can live where the things which are not become as real as the things which are, and the things which now are become shadows of what used to be.  If that seems a little confusing just read on!</p>\n\n<h4>Struggling with Delays</h4>\n<p>Dealing with deferred hope is and always will be a necessary part of the walk of faith.  Any believer who has walked with God for any length of time has had to deal with promises that went unfulfilled for a time or even a lifetime.  What is the secret of this kind of faith?  Is it a matter of pure optimism?  How did Abraham endure such a long delay before Isaac was born?  Even after it was physically possible to bear a child he is described as having hope against hope, not considering his own body.  How he did it is a matter of focus, but what he entered was far greater than the promise itself.  He walked and lived in the realm of God?s own habitation.  Once we have learned the secret of entering that realm, no delay will ever again discourage us, and nothing will be impossible.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately the life of faith is a life of dying to ones own expectations and timetables.  Getting to that place of rest and peace can be difficult.  Recently I was again touched by just how difficult it can be when some friend came to me with a problem.  The issue came down to believing God when their hope was failing.  Delay after delay had brought them to the brink of hopelessness.  I hurt for them just hearing the frailty of their hope.  It felt as though they could not handle even one more day of delay.  They stood, believing God for a promise, and it seemed it was my job to encourage them.  They desperately needed encouragement.  I struggled with the issue knowing that they wanted me to tell them an answer was imminent.  Having walked this walk for sometime I knew that imminent is a matter of interpretation and while the promise of God is always imminent that does not translate into immediate.  The teaching that follows in this article was my response to them. </p>\n<p>The Hebrew writer addressed believers who themselves waited for a promise.  They were wavering under the weight of oppression and persecution, having already paid a dear price for their faith.  Their earthly goods pilfered and they were suffering under severe tribulation (Hebrews 10:34).  What wonderful words of comfort were given them?  It went like this:<br />?For yet a little while, and He who is coming will come and will not tarry.  Now the just shall live by faith; but if anyone draws back, my soul has no pleasure in him.? (Hebrews 10:37-38)</p>\n<p>Wow!  What a promise!  He is coming, and He is coming right away.  These must have been very refreshing words indeed.  Certainly they were meant to be words of encouragement as they suggested a mere momentary delay.  It is not unlike a child calling their father only to hear ?just a minute I will be right there?.  Unfortunately the statement ?right there? is a matter of interpretation.  Often our Heavenly Father?s timeline is not quite the same as ours.  In this case He apparently meant, wait until you?re dead, since this promise was not fulfilled in their lifetime.  He who was to come did not come, and yet we know God cannot lie.  But the tone of the promise suggested immediate.  How can this be?  And furthermore, how does one deal with such an impossible postponement of a promise?</p>\n<p>How does one remain in a state of continual expectation for such long periods of time as did Abraham?  Whether we are speaking of 25, 30 or 50 years this is not humanly possible.  The emotions of man cannot endure ups and downs of this kind. Which is exactly what we want to say.  It is in fact NOT humanly possible; it takes a supernatural experience.  This is where faith comes in.  Faith releases us into supernatural perspective and provision of confidence.  There is a place of unwavering security that makes us immune to the ebb and flow of human passions.  Once you experience its strength and sense of permanence, you realize everything else is untrustworthy.  You discover the fleeting quality of all that is natural, that it is in fact temporary and lacking true substance.  Faith gives us a glimpse into the unseen realm showing us its tangible nature.   Once we have acquired a taste for it, the natural becomes like a vapor which is there one moment and gone the next. This was certainly Paul?s perspective.</p>\n<p>?? while we do not look at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen.  For the things which are seen are temporary, but the things which are not seen are eternal in the heavens.? (2 Corinthians 4:18)</p>\n<p>He went on to declare how this perspective filled him with a longing to be free from this ?tent?.  This is the confidence released by a living faith.  If you have never tasted it, you might think this kind of talk is imaginary.  On the contrary it should be a progressive part of our daily existence.  It is a part of our journey.<br />The journey is an adventure into the promises of God. Through this journey the Lord means to bring us to a place where the actual and literal fulfillment of the promise is almost immaterial.  That place is the point where ?faith literally is the substance of the thing hoped for? (Hebrews 11:6). When you have that substance, you don?t really care what else happens because, for all intensive purposes, you already have your promise.  The journey calls for a ?laying down? of the visible on which we previously depended.  The process of laying down what was safe, is what we call dying to it.  Each step of faith requires more dying, but with each death comes a resurrection.   Thus, this walk of faith is in reality a death march.  But regardless of the kind of journey it always begins with a promise.</p>\n<h4>The Promise</h4>\n<p>In 1989 I began such a journey.  While I was teaching in a ministry school the Lord began to draw my heart for the Body of Christ at large.  I had prayed and considered various ministry roles only to come to the realization that I was unsuited for most of them.  Suddenly the Lord spoke a Word that would change the course of my life.</p>\n<p>It came out of Ezekiel 3:17.  <br />?Son of man, I have made you a watchman for the house of Israel; therefore hear a word from My mouth, and give them warning from Me:?</p>\n<p>This word resonated deep in my spirit and carried an authority I could not question.  I had but to consider the promise and I could see the spiritual strength and sphere of a ministry that covered the nation.  I cannot explain in terms of organizational features or people, but I saw something I knew would ultimately have structure and organization.  Not being naturally organizational, I normally would not have had the confidence to initiate a ministry organization.  On this occasion both the impetus and sense of direction seemed to bubble out of me. </p>\n<p>This was great in terms that I was then able to implement some initial steps.  However I did not fully comprehend the journey I was about to begin.  There is a great mystery in what I am about to write to which the reader should pay careful attention. </p>\n<p>When a believer receives a promise of this sort He is introduced to the realm of the spirit in a new way.  For when ?the Lord calls those things which are not as though they are?, He is in fact declaring the end from the beginning.  When the believer is a recipient of this promise, he or she is momentarily taken to the place where space and time ceases.  The revelation now coming to the spirit of a man was not meant to replace the journey he must now take, but to give him the vision of an end, while still at the beginning.<br />The outcome in this case was that I now carried the end of something that was in fact only beginning.  There was a dichotomy that at first seemed a little odd but once I became accustomed to it, paid little attention.  The dichotomy played out as follows.  I was able to walk out the steps to initiating this ministry vision but received very little outside support.  Most colleagues would attempt to discourage me from pursuing the goals I outlined.  Yet, for me it was as though those things were already finished.  Still, when I really thought about what it was I was pursuing it seemed ridiculous.</p>\n<p>At the time I was 27 years old with very little ministry experience.  Though I had worked as a student pastor in a couple of situations and presently taught in a ministry school I would have been labeled a novice by most.  Yet I had the courage and strength to presume to launch an itinerate ministry to the church without the endorsement and support of any outside organization.  Furthermore I proposed writing articles in a newsletter we would publish, though at the time I was a terrible writer.  The landscape of ministry open doors was dismal.  No one knew who I was or cared to invite me to minister and we had no foreseeable means of financial support.  Yet, because I had in effect seen the end from the beginning I could not be discouraged or swayed from this direction.</p>\n<p>This, I can safely say was not the optimism which comes from being organizational or visionary.  It was a confidence forged in the furnace of God?s own Word.  Unfortunately there were many miles to travel before what was real in my spirit would begin to take shape in the realm I presently lived.  Not understanding this fact was the source of the first mistake.</p>\n<h4>The First Mistake</h4>\n<p>When I received the promise I saw the end from the beginning.  The assumption quite naturally is that the end is near.  Because it was too real and so tangible, it therefore must be right around the corner.  At the time I did not realize that when the Word of the Lord comes we are taken above the plain of time.  That is the reason why faith preachers will often talk about faith and imminent promises being woven together.  <br />Surely all of us have heard at least one sermon on Hebrew 11:1.  It begins by saying ?Now faith is??.   The suggestion being that faith is always NOW!  This is not a lie.  When we carry a promise of God in our spirits there is always a sense of imminence.  Why?  Not because there will no longer be the passing of time, but because our spirits must rise above the realm of the present in order to see the end.  This was the dichotomy I found so perplexing.  When I would think of the actual circumstances in which I found myself, the direction seemed presumptuous and unlikely.  On the other hand what I had seen was too real to ignore.  It birthed an anticipation and a strength of hope which simply overruled any reluctance.</p>\n<p>So what one really has are two opposites.   There are those things that God has called into being but which are not (not yet that is), and those things which presently are.  The journey is in fact a bringing together of the two until they are reconciled with one another.  This is the journey of faith maintained by perseverance.   The perseverance is a willful and deliberate looking at the promise despite what objections and barriers stand in their way.  It requires a regular choice as to which one is real (permanent reality) and which one is not.  One does not need to deny the present, only realize the promise is as eternal as the One who gave it.</p>\n<p>The greatest joy of having a promise is not the receiving of the thing promised.  The greatest joy and reward of faith is its ability to take us above the plain of the natural.  It enables us to transcend the fickle passions of human ?wants?, to live in the timeless presence of the Everlasting Father.  The Words of Promise are not just I.O.U?s we one day hope to collect on, rather, they are windows  into eternity.  They give us the means to bask in the reality of the Lord?s timeless dominion.  With this resource in hand, maintaining one?s confession of confidence is a simple task, no matter how long the wait.</p>'),(35,'Lord','<p />Many of the things Jesus said and did were a contradiction. He was called to public ministry and yet made extraordinary efforts to remain hidden.  When His family saw this they pointed out the inconsistency saying,  ?For no one does anything in secret, while he himself seeks to be known openly.  If you do these things,\n\nshow yourself to the world.? (John 7:4)  The question is a good one!  Why would someone, whose ultimate goal was to be known, deliberately make every effort to stay concealed?  The answer is twofold!  First, Jesus understood the nature of man and could not afford the smallest expression of personal ambition.  Secondly, in order to accomplish His journey, He was utterly committed to dependence upon the Holy Spirit!</p>\n<h4>The Pattern</h4>\n<p>One of the amazing things Jesus walked in was a sense of security.  He neither needed nor sought the endorsement of men.  As such He was comfortable with both popularity and anonymity.  This of course is in contrast to the typical man.  Even if we are the type that might feel uncomfortable with the spotlight, something within us desires the affirmation and notice of others.  When opportunities arose to broadcast His name, Jesus did nothing to exploit them.  In fact he sometimes did the very opposite. </p>\n<p>On one occasion Matthew records Peter?s great revelation, when Peter identified Jesus as the Christ (Matt. 16:16).  After commending him as having heard this from heaven He forbade the disciples from revealing his identity.</p>\n<p>?Then He commanded His disciples that they should tell no one that He was Jesus the Christ.? (Matthew 16:20)</p>\n<p>On another occasion Jesus was casting out an unclean spirit when it cried out His true identity.  ?I know who You are?the Holy One of God!? (Luke 4:34)  Rather than using this as an opportunity to make Himself known Jesus told the spirit to ?be quiet, and come out of him!? (Vs. 35)  This was repeated again in Mark 3:12, where it says unclean spirits often fell down cried out ?You are the Son of God?.  On each occasion ?He sternly warned them that they should not make Him known.?  On a few other occasions Jesus sought to limit the broadcast of notable healings and issued publication bans.  Mark writes after healing a leper, Jesus ?strictly warned him? about telling others. (1:43)</p>\n<p>?See that you say nothing to anyone;? (Mark 1:44)</p>\n<p>It was not that Jesus was against anyone knowing who He was; it was rather an issue of the Holy Spirit and of the right timing.  Because Jesus was comfortable with being hidden He was not driven to advertise Himself.  Instead, He was conscious of the times and seasons of the Lord.  This is reflected in the statement made to His mother at the wedding of Cana.  When pushed to do something He responded, ?My hour has not yet come? (John 2:4).  Of course, He was about to do His first miracle and so we know His hour was about to begin.  Still, He was not impatient or driven by ambition.  This is a vital lesson to learn if we hope to be used in some capacity.  The quicker we learn these things the more useful we will be.  I certainly wish I could have learned this a little sooner.</p>\n<h4>The Anti-Pattern</h4>\n<p>When I first began in ministry I believed myself to be in possession of some significant faith.  In fact, in my ignorance, I considered myself utterly dependent upon the Holy Spirit.  While I did possess a little faith and much zeal, I was disappointed and shocked to discover my actual faith level.   The discovery happened as it usually does ? suddenly!  While attending a series of meetings in my city, the speaker began sharing how much he trusted God for his finances.  His statement went something like this,  ?God is our source and not offerings?.  Normally I might have shouted a hearty Amen, but this time I was struck with a truth.  Up to that very moment I would have thought I shared that same faith as this man.  But in that split second the Lord showed me my heart.  </p>\n<p>The truth was I had been talking the language of faith far above what I actually possessed.  I had been around enough to know what a person of faith would say.  In my awkward but sincere attempts to demonstrate reliance on the Lord, I went about saying the right things.  Unfortunately this is entirely different from actually believing.  Faith is a matter of the heart and not a matter of the mind.  It is not a matter of correct words but of a correct spirit.  And while, with the right teaching, we can train our minds to think and say the right things, it is with the heart that one actually believes.  ?For with the heart one believes??(Romans 10:10).  Guiding our minds and tongues to think and say the right things is a step in the right direction, but it is not the conclusion of the matter, it is the beginning.</p>\n<p>When I saw the littleness of my faith I was shocked.  While I had certainly been obedient in doing the preliminary things, I was awakened to the fact that most of my hope was rooted in man.  In that split second I was awakened to the fact that the number of churches I ministered in and the number of subscribers to our publication was the real key to my confidence.  I appealed to the arm of flesh by working feverishly to make myself as visible as possible.  Driven by unbelief, I attempted to create activity around me in the hopes that people would notice my call and my anointing.  If I had been waving flags in the air yelling ?pick me, pick me?, I would not have been less conspicuous.  Even worse, was the fact that I was doing these things in the name of ?serving God and promoting the vision?.  Tragically, the activity I thought was the obedience of faith was in reality the commotion of unbelief.  My flesh desperately wanted to be noticed whereas the Lord desperately wanted me hidden.  In time I was to understand the vanity of seeking a large place when the Lord is giving a small one.</p>\n<p>At the time I did not understand the process of the Lord?s refining. The call of the Lord was not a call to works but to a fiery furnace, which would produce a pure faith.  Then, in due time, pure works would emerge from a pure faith.  It was necessary to take these initial steps of obedience.  However while I considered them an end the Lord considered them a beginning.</p>\n<p>I was soon to discover that for faith to come forward we must come to see God and God alone as our only source.  And while I thought that this was my present posture, my desperation and anxiety should have told me otherwise.  The truth was I was infected by a ?blindness? to my own flesh.  I had underestimated the pervasive power of my flesh and it had deceived me.  Unlike Jesus, I did not understand the nature of man (my own flesh) and I was clearly ignorant of the true requirements for kingdom outcomes.</p>\n<h4>Pervasive Flesh</h4>\n<p>My failure at the time was simply the absence of knowledge.  I failed to realize my flesh was a two-sided coin.  While I focused my energy on avoiding obvious sin, dead works were appearing.  Dead works are characterized and defined as being lifeless and void of the breath of Life.  While evil works are most certainly dead, dead works can have every appearance of ?good?.  It is not the appearance of the work that determines its classification; it is its source of origin.  As Jesus said, ??the flesh profits nothing.? (John 6:63)  In our ignorance the good of our flesh can often be mistaken for faith and righteousness.  Jesus understood this and remained skeptical of his own flesh. He knew that flesh is always seeking an opportunity to express itself and must be suppressed at every turn.  The answer was simple and is reflected in this conviction:  ?I only say what I hear the Father say, and do what I see the Father doing.?  He determined that the safest course would be to avoid anything that might conceivably be born of self.</p>\n<p>Herein is one of the mysteries of the Kingdom of God and a paradox of great depth.  Though Jesus was destined to be known in the nation, He understood that a quest for fame is a great veneer for the flesh.  Since the flesh of man is hungry for validation, reward and influence it cannot be trusted.  The flesh of man is His Achilles heel.   In the wilderness temptation Satan precisely targeted this area when he suggested Jesus throw Himself from the temple.  Surely the angles of God would save him and he would have the necessary validation to expand His following.  If Jesus were seeking a following this would have been sufficient.  However, He does not seek a following, He seeks a Kingdom. </p>\n<p>Therefore a key requirement for a Kingdom outcome is activity initiated by nothing more than obedience to the Word of the Lord.  This requires faith in the invisible hand of God.  It is summarized in this statement saying, ?If the Lord wants me to be known, no one can keep me concealed?.  So when I try to conceal myself I am not working against the declared will of the Lord, but rather putting to death the insidious devices of my own flesh.  The impulse to do the right things for the wrong reasons cannot be given any expression.  Jesus simply refused to allow public exposure unless He was specifically commanded. <br />He did not abandon the call to the nation.  Rather He knew this call could only materialize through steadfast and careful obedience.  Being seen and known would be an eventual outcome, but this was not the guiding principle of His life.  Instead, knowing His end, He determined to live by every Word that proceeded from the mouth of God.  In order to avoid giving place to His flesh, Jesus needed to trust the revelation of His identity to the Father.  The exercise of faith meant laboring to be hidden rather than to be seen.  This posture would ensure that His ultimate exposure could never be traced to self-promotion, but to the power of the Holy Spirit.</p>\n<p>This was the reason He did not go up to the feast based on pragmatic wisdom.   Though it made perfect sense to do this, He lived by a higher wisdom.  This same wisdom was behind his regular requests for secrecy concerning great miracles.  Conventional wisdom would have us exploit miracles to increase the scope of our ?witness?.  It would be easy for us to justify on the basis that more would come to know Christ.  But our appeal must not be to the force of marketing but the force of the Spirit.  This is not to say we are to abandon these mediums.  Rather, we must be content to walk in the scope of the sphere given by the presence of the Lord, and not what is desirable to bring mere increase.  There is an increase of the Spirit that leads to Life and there is an increase that leads to devastation.  Many setbacks in the historical church can be traced to the latter.  But the Church of the Harvest must come to know the difference!</p>\n<h4>Revealing Power</h4>\n<p>The example of Jesus is a template for all modern ministries.  His unwavering belief in the administration of the Holy Spirit is expressed in maxims such as this one. ?No one can know the Son or the Father without revelation? (Matthew 11:27).  In essence He said, ?I am content to only be known by those to whom the Father reveals me?.  Furthermore, ?I can only be known to those whose eyes are specifically opened by My Father?.  He implicitly trusted the ability of the Holy Spirit to override all natural modern principles of advertising and marketing.  Having emptied Himself of personal ambition He was entirely content to have His true identity concealed.</p>\n<p>Generally speaking He followed this course for two reasons.  First, He understood the danger of running outside of the grace and timing of the Father.  The risk to His life was continuous and great.  Since the enemy was always seeking to kill Him He needed to walk obediently under the covering of the Father. Secondly, and perhaps more importantly, He knew the purity of spirit required for the work of God.  What is flesh is flesh and what is spirit is spirit.  Whatever is born of faith overcomes the world.  The good things of our flesh overcome nothing.  Jesus understood that for the Kingdom of God to emerge it must be born of faith and specific obedience.  Since the flesh seeks expression at any cost, He could not afford activity that could be justified as being consistent with the Kingdom, but not born of God.</p>\n<p>Ambition makes us want to do things, no matter what the time or season.  Our flesh, in search of a sense of importance and significance, seeks to be ?useful? by initiating activities.  The question of the surface value of these activities is not the central issue.  They can easily display a form of godliness and yet lack the power.  Thus our journey is a requiem of death to the flesh as we lay down our inner need to do. The Lord will train us by restraining us from the opportunity to ?do?.  This is one of the ways the Father will manifest and mortify our flesh, by making us wait to fulfill what we know we are supposed to do.  It is one of the means the Lord uses to distinguish between the urges that are of the spirit and the urges coming from the flesh.</p>\n<p>This raises many issues for those who are looking to bring glory to the Lord.  For example, if you think you have a ministry and that the devil and others are suppressing your fame, you are misinformed.  If the Lord does not want you to be known, any attempt to ?open the eye of others? will only show your ambition.  In the Kingdom of God you cannot reveal ?who? you are in the Lord, only God can do that.  Any attempt to do so will come off like cheap hype.  On the other hand when it comes time for you to be established in your ministry, the divine authority God gives will clothe you in an unmistakable way.  You won?t be able to hide who you are.  In addition, there is no need to advertise your name or your worth.  So if you find yourself in a small place be content and be faithful.  God is not mocked, He who sows to the flesh shall reap corruption but He who sows to the spirit will reap Life. </p>\n<h4>Conclusion</h4>\n<p>In the ministry of Jesus there were several distinct phases to his public face.  In some of the previous examples it is clear Jesus worked to maintain anonymity.  Yet,  later on He did not seem to take the same approach.   Two approaches for two different seasons.  But what criterion tells us what phase we are in?  For my own ministry I remember very distinctly the time when the favor of the Lord fell on me.  Before that moment it was useless to even share what I felt called to.  Even when people would ask me I struggled to bring a clear definition to who I was in the Lord.  When the season changed it was not difficult to see the difference.  Rather than having to announce myself, the Lord was clearly going before me.  There was a grace and ease that cannot be explained other than through divine intervention.  These seasons also correspond to the life of Jesus.  One begins in Luke 3:22 where the Father speaks over the Son.  <br />?You are My beloved Son; in You I am well pleased.?</p>\n<p>This first season is a critical time of formation wherein the spirit of sonship is released to us.  During this time the Father repeatedly tells us we are His and that He is pleased in us.  For Jesus the second season began right after the incident on the mount of transfiguration when the Father speaks for the second time.  On this occasion He does not speak to Jesus but to those who should receive Him. </p>\n<p>And a voice came out of the cloud, saying, ?This is My beloved Son.  Hear Him!? (Luke 9:35)<br />At this point the Father tells the world who we are. </p>\n<p>And so our service to the Lord can be said to consist of two phases.  The first begins with the blessing of God coming to us personally.  In this time the Father is affirming our identity.  This affirmation is not so others can hear or know us, but so that we can become secure in whom He has called us to be.  The evidence of that security is in the fact that we require no affirmation but the Lord?s.  Having this security is critical to our future and will determine to what degree we can truly represent the Father.  When that is complete we are ready for the second phase.  This is where the Lord brings us out of hiding. During this season the Lord will go before us and announce us.  Until that time we need to discipline our flesh and pursue hiddenness.  As such it never hurts to pray, ?Lord keep me hidden!?</p>'),(36,'A Matter of the Heart','<p>There is one scripture which defines man\'s condition in the clearest possible terms. It reads, \'The heart is deceitful above all things, and desperately wicked; Who can know it?\', Jeremiah 17:9.</p>\n\n<p>The question \'Who can know it?\', is quickly answered in the next verse: \'I, the Lord, search the heart,...\' The implication is man cannot know it. If it is our goal to have a pure heart we are facing an impossible task... humanly speaking. We have the power to adjust our thinking, modify our behavior and temper our emotions, but how can a man make himself see what his heart does not wish to see? When the \'heart\' - that part of us which interprets the world around us and tells our minds what it means - is skewed and warped how can there be any hope of real purity? Yet, becoming increasingly pure in heart is a major part of our mandate. Perhaps, this is what the Apostle Paul was speaking about when he admonished us to work out our salvation with fear and trembling! It is like having the responsibility to walk a line, without ever being entirely sure where that line is. Certainly this is a task requiring a great deal of humility on our part.</p>\n<h4>The Scientific Community</h4>\n<p>Some years ago I was struck by the foolishness of mankind and his clear lack of humility. We repeatedly place our trust in that which cannot be trusted. Consider for example the fields of modern science. Man repeatedly celebrates his own magnificence as fresh scientific discoveries are made. Yet, he fails to appreciate that each new discovery disqualifies a previous theory & meaning, for years and sometimes decades man will hold to a theory which is wrong. When he discovers what he believes is the \'actual\' truth, the old theory is dismissed out of hand without so much as a thought. Whereas, he should be in shock at believing a lie for so long, there is little or no recognition of this fact. It is either purposely or unknowingly \'glossed over\'. The joy of fresh insight blinds him to the issue which should always be before him. That is, \'how can I trust what I presently believe about the world when tomorrow I may discover something which will invalidate what I believe to be true today?\'. </p>\n<p>It reminds me of something I read by Richard Wurmbrand the founder of \'Voice of the Martyrs\'. He said, \'Distrust your mind, the same mind which yesterday made decisions which we know to be wrong today, we trust to make decisions for tomorrow\'. Scripture echoes this admonition saying \'Cursed is the man who trust in man and makes flesh his strength, whose heart departs from the Lord\', Jeremiah 17:5. This passage tells us there is something wrong within mankind which goes beyond the mind; a component of our being which will always deceive him and which cannot be trusted. Furthermore, this \'something\' is a part of who we are at our very core; it cannot be circumvented or avoided. No matter how intellectually \'open\' or \'honest with ourselves\' we may think we are, mankind cannot get beyond himself. This is one of the reasons we need Jesus!</p>\n<h4>The Christian Predicament</h4>\n<p>Becoming a Christian is no guarantee we will ever fully get past this issue. When one becomes a believer, he has only begun to deal with the problem of the heart. While we are usually quick to declare our trust in the Lord, such declarations come from a superficial understanding of the problem. Because trust is not just a matter of the mind, it is a matter of the heart. We often confuse \'trust\' and \'sincerity\'. This is especially relevant in the issue of faith. How often have we heard believers say, \'I believed with all my heart, and it did not happen\'. How does one then deal with the scripture which says \'anything is possible to him who believes\'? Did Jesus lie? Obviously not! Rather, to believe with one\'s heart is not nearly the same as being optimistic or hopeful. We trust with our heart; we express sincerity with our mind. This means one can be entirely convinced of something in his mind without the slightest conviction in his heart. The heart is that illusive component of our being which gives expression to our deepest desires. Unfortunately, the heart is hidden to the mind. If that were not enough of a problem, add to it the fact the heart is wicked and deceptive. </p>\n<p>When we get saved selfish motives of the flesh in our heart go \'underground\'. They hide behind the veil of \'good works\', hoping to live another day undetected. They remind me of the Nazi guards from World War II concentration camps. As the Allied forces closed in on them, many dressed in prisoners clothing in the hope of avoiding arrest. Likewise our heart plays the chameleon game of adapting to a fresh morality, always resistant to real change. It will happily sacrifice overt expressions of evil for the preservation of inner darkness. Like man himself, the heart will do anything to preserve itself.</p>\n<p>This brings us to a most critical issue: When can we ever be sure of ourselves? The answer is a resounding, \'Never!\'. We can never be sure of ourselves. This is why it is foolishness to trust in man. We can only be sure of the Lord. This is a part of what it means to \'trust in the Lord with all of your heart and not to lean on your own understanding\' (Proverbs 3:5). Following the Lord means a decision for believing God as opposed to man. What we have failed to realize is that \'believing man\' includes yourself. \'Let God be true and every man a liar\' (Romans 3:4). For this same reason Jeremiah tells us we are cursed if we trust in man. To trust in man means to depart from the Lord; to trust in the Lord means to leave trusting ourselves. This is impossible to do if we have not fully seen the deceptiveness of the human heart. Once we have begun to truly see the heart, our perspective of the Christian life begins to change. </p>\n<p>My initial perspective of the Christian life was like most others. I thought the chief objective of radical Christianity was to dedicate all my energies to the service to God. My Christianity quickly became the sum total of my outward actions. If anyone was in doubt of my faith I could simply point to my works. I thought I was like James who proposed to \'show faith by my works\' (James 2:18). During this period I did a great deal of \'showing (off) my faith\'. Little did I realize! I was about to discover that while true faith will be demonstrated in works, not all works are the evidence of true faith. </p>\n<p>Jesus\' dealings with the so-called righteous should stand as a continual warning to us. The Pharisee\'s were religious hypocrites who were preoccupied with \'looking good\'. With all their strength they worked at being as faithful as they could possibly be; but the very best men can muster is cursed before God. The outcome of our life in Christ is not so much the pursuit of \'fruit\', but the production of increasingly pure fruit, from an increasingly pure heart. The quality of the fruit is determined by the quality of the tree. Remember, a bad tree cannot bear good fruit (Matthew 7:18). While I thought I knew and understood this principle, I did not. When I read \'The heart is deceitful above all things, and desperately wicked\', I believed it was speaking of others,... or at least the unsaved.</p>\n<p>My first real insight into my own \'heart matters\' came in the spring of 1982, while attending Christ for the Nations in Dallas, Texas. It was my first semester and I had been serving the Lord less than a year. My pursuit of the Lord had brought me repeatedly to the love chapter in Corinthians (13). It read:</p>\n<p>\'Love suffers long and is kind; love does not envy; love does not parade itself, is not puffed up; does not behave rudely, does not seek its own, is not provoked, thinks no evil; does not rejoice in iniquity, but rejoices in the truth;...\' (1 Corinthians 13:4-6)</p>\n<p>I had become very familiar with these passages and the remainder of the chapter. Since it was my goal to become loving, I applied myself to practicing these principles as best I could. In my mind I was doing a fine job of living up to Biblical \'requirements\'. Despite my sincerity I was deceived. And as most who are deceived, I did not know it - that is the nature of being deceived, you are unaware. Thankfully I was about to be delivered from my ignorance. I was about to receive a greater measure of the truth which would set me free. </p>\n<h4>Going Under the Knife (Sword)</h4>\n<p>For months I had been praying in the spirit for profound change to come to my life. But I never really understood why until this day. With stunning clarity the Holy Spirit wielded the Word of God into my heart. As I read these same Corinthian passages I had become so familiar with, it became the Sword of the Spirit. The purity of the love of God began to unfold before me which each verse I read. I began beholding the glory of God in the face of Jesus (2 Corinthians 3:18). It did two things: First it revealed how pure and true was the love of God. Then, as a direct and immediate effect of that revelation, I saw the self-serving motivations of my heart. Words cannot adequately convey the shock of those brief but seemingly endless moments. </p>\n<p>The outer veneer of my good works began to peel back exposing hidden ambitions. What was previously a kind gesture to a fellow student stood open and exposed before the revelation of the Sword of the Spirit. Hidden behind was a calculated effort to impress others; the need to convince myself I was a candidate for a great ministry; a desire to excel above others. The various implications of what I saw were numerous. I was deeply stunned! As I continued to read the passages the level of conviction continued to increase. Tears began to roll down my cheeks as surprise gave way to horror. The depth of my hearts deceptive powers matched those of the most malevolent creatures I had seen depicted in movies and history. \'How could this be?\', I questioned.</p>\n<p>Continuing to read, it seemed as though every fiber of my being was a lie. Like Isaiah I thought, \'Woe am I! for I am undone; because I am a man of unclean lips, and I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips: for my eyes have seen the King, the LORD of hosts.\' (Isaiah 6:5) So bright was this glory it seemed to leave no stone unturned. Images of my daily lifestyle began to filter through my mind as I read down through the verses. When I came to the passage which said \'love does not parade itself\', I immediately saw myself dancing in chapel times. What I thought had been to the Lord suddenly became part of the elaborate attempt to appear spiritual. Possessing only a grain of true worship the majority of my attention was toward the student body. I had been performing for onlookers! Esteeming myself \'set apart\', a \'true member\' of an elite core of worshipers, I believed my dancing to be evidence of a superior dedication to which others should aspire. As the pride of my heart was being exposed the sense of repulsion I felt for myself made me want to hide. But where could I go?</p>\n<p>When it seemed I would soon be crushed under the awesome weight of what seemed to be \'cruel truth\', the experience took a dramatic turn for the worse. I saw the open hands of Jesus holding what seemed to be a ugly mass of pure filth. So vivid was the vision I turned my head at the sight and smell. Unable to determine its form I asked the Lord what it was. He replied almost casually, \'This is your heart!\'. As painful as everything had been to that moment this seemed like a deathblow which I could not endure. My thoughts turned like a whirlwind as I exited the room. Running across the courtyard I made my way to the prayer room above the cafeteria where I collapsed inches from the doorway.</p>\n<p>My entire world seemed to be shaken as I lay sobbing. A combination of embarrassment, shame, shock, and disqualification flooded my being. Suddenly from the far side of the room a voice rang out in prophecy. It was another student who had been there quietly praying, unaware of what was happening to me. The words were both commending and accepting as the Father assured me of my place in His house and His love for me. Shame turned to comfort as in the shadow of some severe discipline His unchanging love shone through. </p>\n<h4>The Fruit of Revelation</h4>\n<p>The fruit of this encounter with the Lord is both great and varied. Above all of the perceptions gained, an awareness of the deceptiveness of the heart, remains the most critical. If my own heart was selfish and deceptive, how could it be trusted to give my mind pure insights. The answer was clear: Man is unable of objective judgment. Without the light of Christ\'s truth piercing through the darkness of our lives, we will always misinterpret what we see. It is the proverbial issue we so often see in the media today regarding the police department and issues of misconduct by them. Who polices the police? Can the police be trusted to properly judge themselves?</p>\n<p>The heart of man is deceitfully wicked and unable to accurately judge itself. Infected by self-interest it cannot be objective. In as much as we cannot physically lift ourselves into the air, we cannot distance ourselves from the motives of the heart. This holds true whether or not you are a believer. Coming to Christ is the beginning of change, not the consummation. But since the heart holds a position of power it uses that power to insulate itself from change. It goes to great lengths to weave an elaborate trail of deception, permitting superficial acts of goodness which serve only to mask greater depths of wickedness. What then is the answer to this human dilemma? The answer is simple! It is found in the humility which turns us to the Lord at the revelation of our hopeless condition. Our only hope is to hunger and thirst for the Truth, realizing we remain blind if we think we already see (John 9:41).</p>\n<p><em>©2000 Watchman on the Wall Ministries.

This call is now resounding with growing urgency.  It is time to give ourselves to the pursuit of his heart with unwavering commitment.  This should not be mistaken as a call to increased \'spiritual activity\'.  While in some cases this may be a requirement, the present call is for a change of heart demonstrated in the mundane everyday matters of life. Spiritual activity can easily be \'lips which draw near\' while the heart is far off.  Rather, the Lord is requiring a willingness to be challenged at the deepest levels of our heart saying, \'Seek the Lord while He may be found, call upon Him while he is near(Isaiah 55:6)\'. </p>\n\n<h4>High School </h4>\n<p>While this is not a new word, there is an added intensity since it first resonated in my heart five years ago.  At the time I understood the Church was being prepared for it\'s greatest days.  Yet many, who were holding to the promise of approaching harvest, were not embracing their preparation.  It was as though we were High School students, caught up in the social politics of adolescence, oblivious to the real world.  Preoccupied with a \'quest for status\' and a place of prominence in a fading limelight, many were being distracted from their primary purpose.  The parallels were clear!</p>\n<p>High School presents a compelling atmosphere where young people begin to make their mark on the world.  It comes complete with its own cultural taboo\'s and social order.  The extreme passion for identity creates a vacuum wherein teenagers strive for acceptance and position.  Personal worth is measured in achievement and popularity.  Consequently, a great deal of devotion is laid on this altar.  Escaping it\'s grasp requires young people with a longterm vision.  Those who do can give themselves to goals which are more enduring.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, being at the hub of social activity is vital for a good portion of students.  Many, if not most, are consumed with some portion of High School\'s environment and are blinded to the things which are truly critical.  In this environment, skipping classes and being accepted by peers becomes more important than studying, and making the most of High School\'s educational opportunity.  Yet, soon the day comes when High School finishes, and in a manner of speaking, life begins.  Before long students begin to realize life does not consist of High School.  Rather, it is a tiny picture of a much larger reality in which High School status counts for little.  It is at this moment when our time in High School becomes our foundation, or the lack thereof.</p>\n<h4>In the Church</h4>\n<p>Likewise the Church has been in a time of serious training.  Like in High School, the attributes developed within us will ultimately determine our future success.  Our training has less to do with how we appear on the outside than on the inside.  When we are concerned about prestige and our position before men, we will focus on what others think of us. Unfortunately for many, appearances, while vital in High School, count for much less in life.  On the other hand, multitudes of believers are currently being prepared for their hour, having understood this fact.  Because of this, they are being prepared beyond the view and understanding of men.</p>\n<p>Like the eagle which soars to the highest heights the Lord has been preparing his vessels through brokenness and humility.  Soon strong fresh winds will begin to blow. It will force many to look for shelter and a place of safety.  At the same time, seemingly out of nowhere, a new generation of leaders will emerge from the confines of their \'spiritual wind tunnels\'.  Having undergone years of vigorous training they will know how to ride the wind.  They will have embraced the discipline of the Lord and will be ready when the time comes. </p>\n<h4>The Training</h4>\n<p>To this end we have been teaching, exhorting and warning believers.  Our preaching has focused on words which help us understand and cooperate with the breaking of our heart\'s fallow ground.  We cry out as the prophet Hosea cried:</p>\n<p>\'Sow for yourselves righteousness; reap in mercy; break up your fallow ground, for it is time to seek the Lord, till He comes and rain righteousness on you.\'(Hosea 10:12)</p>\n<p>The object of the Lord\'s training has been to produce a true faith in our hearts.  This requires a two-edged sword piercing to the division of soul and spirit.  It divides between the holy and the profane, bringing to light the intents of the heart.  The training the Lord has been bringing has not been to bring conformity to our behavior.  Rather, His dealings expose us from the inside out in order to bring genuine transformation.  In our next publication we will deal more decisively with the process.</p>\n<p>For the time being let us focus on the urgency of this admonition.  The Spirit of God is pleading with us to embrace the exposing and thus breaking of the fallow ground of our heart &endash; not later, but now!  The key to this word surrounds the issue of timing.  The urging of the Spirit is that this should happen before the outpouring begins. </p>\n<p>While being personally convinced this was indeed what the Spirit has been saying, I wondered at the urgency of the call.  \'If there was coming a time of unparalleled glory and authority in the Church, why would there not be time for additional preparation and the pruning of hearts? New converts would certainly require it.  But what would keep us from undergoing a heart circumcision at the outset of this new period?\'  I did not have a clear answer but continued to seek the Lord.  On a recent trip to the East Coast the Lord gave me a clear answer.</p>\n<h4>The Burned Grass</h4>\n<p>It came while a friend was telling me about the heat wave and the shortage of rain throughout this summer.  As we looked at their severely burned lawn the Lord gently spoke 3 things to my heart:</p>\n<p>The first came as I observed how despite the heat and the lack of rain, the weeds were still green.  Scattered throughout the shriveled yellow grass were spots of rich green color.  The contrast brought to mind the curse which said, \'cursed is the ground for your sake... thorns and thistles shall it bring forth for you\'. (Genesis 3:17-18)  Indeed this was true!  Grass and flowers struggle along for their existence while weeds flourish no matter what the situation.  Looking on the Lord spoke into my spirit saying, \'In the Kingdom everything is reversed\'.  I instantly realized that the Kingdom of God brought redemption.  Meaning our times of dryness will wither the weeds of our heart, while what is born of the Word of God endures forever (1 Peter 1:23).  In the trial of our faith what is born of faith overcomes the world while everything else fades.  I became immediately grateful for the periods when the Lord led me into the wilderness.</p>\n<p>As I thought about this the Lord spoke again saying the drought conditions slowed the growth of both the weeds and the grass.  This meant the times of \'spiritual drought\' were windows of opportunity.  They were times when we could prepare the ground of our heart by weeding it.  Since the growing cycle of thorns and thistles was slowed to a fraction of what it could be, it would be far easier to deal with them. </p>\n<p>Again the Lord spoke, this time asking a question: \'What happens when the rains come?\'  The answer was clear! Rain increases the rate of growth.  Suddenly, grass and weeds which had not grown in weeks surge forward at an astounding pace.  If we failed to use the dry season to weed the ground of our heart, their presence would become increasingly prominent.  This was both exciting and scary.  Exciting in the sense that we would see the power and ministry of Jesus unveiled.  Scary in that the weeds left untouched in the soil of our hearts would spring forward at an alarming rate.</p>\n<p>Living in a climate where there is an abundance of rain provided a clear illustration.  A healthy lawn is in a precarious position if it is not diligently maintained.  Moss, weeds, thorns, clover and a broad variety of undesirable growth, is always waiting to dominate.  The prudent will not tolerate any amount, and move quickly to remove them.  Likewise, if we have tolerated sin or areas of selfish gratification during dry seasons, these will surge forward when the rains of the Spirit descends.  What were previously controlable impulses will quickly escalate into raging beasts.  For this reason we must make the most of the time we have.</p>\n<h4>A Fresh Call to Follow</h4>\n<p>The truth is we have not pursued holiness with the level of diligence necessary for the future.  Yet, these prophetic words are resounding in the spirit for the Church to hear.</p>\n<p>\'Break up your fallow ground, and do not sow among the thorns. Circumcise yourselves to the Lord, and take away the foreskins of your hearts, you men of Judah and inhabitants of Jerusalem, lest My fury come forth like fire, and burn so that no one can quench it, because of the evil of your doings.\'(Jeremiah 4:3-4)</p>\n<p>It is particularly interesting that we are exhorted not to sow among the thorns.  Many have been faithfully and diligently sowing the Word of God into their lives.  Unfortunately much of the sowing has been among the thorns. In some cases spirituality, the scripture and the anointing have been used to further our own selfish agenda\'s.  It is a useless venture to invest in teaching tapes and the confession of God\'s Word, if we are not willing to break the fallow ground of our hearts.  If we are consumed with a desire for success, wealth and position we are sowing among thorns.  It is time to circumcise the heart and break the fallow ground. </p>\n<p>\'Come, and let us return to the Lord; for He has torn, but He will heal us; He has stricken, but He will bind us up. After two days He will revive us; On the third day He will raise us up, that we may live in His sight. Let us know, let us pursue the knowledge of the Lord. His going forth is established as the morning; He will come to us like the rain, like the latter and former rain to the earth.\'(Hosea 6:1-3)</p>\n<p>Again the Spirit is calling us to an unwavering commitment. It is not enough to desire an outpouring of God\'s Spirit.  We have been praying and asking for the outpouring of the Lord\'s glory in the Church without realizing the potential cost. Consider this: Why has there not been revival year by year?  Surely, it is in the Lord\'s power to release a continuous wave of the miraculous.  Is there any sensible reason why He would not want a perpetual witness?  The answer comes when we understand the cycles of harvest, which are the cycles of revival.</p>\n<h4>The Cycle\'s of Harvest</h4>\n<p>When Moses led Israel out of Egypt He did it with great fanfare.  The children of Israel saw the acts of God like no other generation before or since.  What was the cost to them? Their corpses fell in the wilderness on account of their unbelief and idolatry (Hebrews 3:17).  To whom much is given, much is required.  The outpouring of the manifestation of God not only accomplishes His end, it requires a higher level of response from the people. </p>\n<p>There are numerous analogies we could use to illustrate this truth.  For example, you cannot put molten iron into a wooden cup.  The cup is not sufficient to sustain it without the iron first destroying the cup.  The power God is going to pour out will fall on all flesh. Whenever there are outpourings of God\'s anointing it not only falls on those who are ready but those who are not. </p>\n<p>The flow of God\'s river is arbitrary.  We see this with the degree of power in the Corinthian Church who, while they were not short of gifts (1 Corinthians 1:6), were carnal and ill suited to rule God\'s Church.  What did the blessing of God bring in their midst? Harmony and sweet fellowship?  No, it brought a harvest of strife and division because their hearts were not circumcised.  Some responded by despising the gifts but that was never really the issue.  You do not know a river by it\'s fruit, you know a tree by it\'s fruit.  The river is the vehicle which helps bring to light the things which are hidden.</p>\n<p>During every major revival in History, there are always those whom God\'s uses mightily, who never finish their course.  One has but to study the Latter Rain outpouring of 1948 along with the Healing Revival.  One after another leaders fell into immorality, doctrinal error, and premature death.  Why?  Because when it rains, it rains on the just and the unjust; it falls on the good seed and the bad seed; it waters the weeds and the grass.</p>\n<p>Jesus said in the parable of the wheat and the tares that the harvest is the end of the age.  Daniel writes, \'Many shall be purified, made white, and refined, but the wicked shall do wickedly; and none of the wicked shall understand, but the wise shall understand\' (Daniel 12:10).  The harvest is the moment when everything comes to maturity. \'God is not mocked; for whatever a man sows, that will he also reap.  For he who sows to his flesh will of the flesh reap corruption, but he who sows to the Spirit will of the spirit reap everlasting life\' (Galatians 6:7-8).  The sound of the abundance of rain has begun to be heard which means the harvest is approaching. He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches.</p>'),(38,'Ascending the Mountain','<p style=\'font-size: 10pt; color: windowtext; font-family: Arial;\'>There is the sound of a trumpet coming from the mountain of the Lord, calling His people to ascend to His presence. The mountain is the place, not only where the Lord dwells, but also the place of transfiguration for those called to approach. As such, it is not so much a singular point of geography as it is a place to which we continually return. It is the place of the radiance of His beauty, where we are all changed into His likeness. As a consequence, the mountain top is also the place of commissioning where the Lord charges His servants with their mandate and authority. As we approach the threshold of yet another commissioning, another tier of authority, we require another level of transformation (2 Cor. 3:18). It is time for us to learn the secret </p>\n\n<p>of entering His heavenly habitation to which we have all been given invitation and access by His blood. Let us go to the mountain of the Lord!<br /><br /><span style=\'font-size: small;\'><span style=\'color: windowtext; font-family: Arial;\'>The Hebrew Exodus<br />I</span></span><span style=\'font-size: 10pt; color: windowtext; font-family: Arial;\'>n Exodus 19 we see Israel summoned from Egypt and carried on the wings of eagles to meet the Lord at Mount Sinai. It was here they were to be set apart and commissioned as the heirs of Abraham?s legacy. <br /><br /></span><em><span style=\'font-size: 10pt; color: windowtext; font-family: Arial;\'>\'You have seen what I did to the Egyptians, and how I bore you on eagles wings and brought you to Myself. Now therefore, if you will indeed obey My voice and keep My covenant, then you shall be a special treasure to Me above all people; for all the earth is Mine. And you shall be to Me a kingdom of priests and a holy nation.\' </span></em><span>(Exodus 19:4-6a)<br /><br />It had always been the vision of God to create a nation of priests. And while Abraham, then Isaac and finally Jacob had each had their moment of commissioning, their descendants had not. Now was the appointed time. Finally the children of Jacob would find the promise within their grasp. The moment they looked for was here, but like their fathers, they must have an encounter with the Lord. Mount Sinai was the appointed place.<br /><br />This was to be a defining moment. For not only would they receive a mandate, but they would be changed. It was this change which would make them the people they needed to become. From there they could transition directly into the land of promise. God would speak, and in so doing, burn His promise deep into their hearts. The encounter would impart to them what was needed for the journey. Like Abraham, Isaac and Jacob before them, the promise and the faith to walk it out would emerge from this time. <br /><br />Without the moment of commissioning there is no authority to go forward. And what Israel failed to understand, which we must not, is that the manifestation of the Lord is a great, and yet terrible thing. For, while experiencing the glory might be a launching mechanism for their journey, it was also a test to determine if they were ready. It was a test of faith. The test was this ? How would they respond to the glory and power of God. What would they do in the face of His pure essence? We might think the glory of the Lord to be a pleasant thing. It is not! Rather, it is the most terrifying event known to creation. Though His essence is love, the hills nevertheless melt like wax before Him. If we are truly convinced of His goodness we can endure the manifestation, but if we harbor any doubts, they will give rise to the impulse to retreat and hide.<br /><br />For Israel, enduring the terror of the Lord as He descended on the mountain was the matter of faith ?<em>for our God is a consuming fire</em>? (Hebrews 12:29 ). It takes faith to hold on when everything you know is being shaken and consumed. When all that seems permanent and fixed is moving like the waves of the sea, faith enables us to press on. In this moment, two things were happening. The resolve of the people?s obedience, which is the essence of their faith, was being refined and tested. Secondly, the manifestation of the Lord was the very thing needed to prepare them for the unfolding journey.<br /><br />In the end it was unbelief which hindered this purpose.<br /><br /></span><em><span style=\'font-size: 10pt; color: windowtext; font-family: Arial;\'>\'And with whom was he displeased forty years? Was it not with them that sinned, whose bodies fell in the wilderness? And to whom swear he that they should not enter into his rest, but to them that were disobedient?</span><span style=\'font-size: 10pt; color: windowtext; font-family: Arial;\'>And we see that they were not able to enter in because of unbelief. Let us fear therefore, lest haply, a promise being left of entering into his rest, any one of you should seem to have come short of it.\'</span></em><span> (Hebrews 3:17-4:1)<br /><br />They retreated from the power of His presence, unable to endure the refining of their souls and thereby not receiving the mandate to proceed. As a nation, they faced the option of a few moments of intense terror, or 40 years of mild suffering. They chose the wilderness - which meant an entire generation would perish. It is interesting to think that what they were being offered was one of two forms of death. Death to self-preservation by enduring the shaking, or death to their very lives.<br /><br />This tells us that the wandering was not a necessary part of the plan. Neither was it the counsel of the Lord which determined it beforehand. What the Lord did require was obedience, ?...if you will indeed obey My voice...?. <br /><br /></span><span style=\'font-size: small;\'><span style=\'color: windowtext; font-family: Arial;\'>The Call<br /></span></span><span>The scripture records that these things were written for our example. In fact, one could argue that the history of Israel is a shadow of the struggles the Church has faced and is currently facing. So, in keeping with this pattern, we should know there is a call being sounded at this very moment. The summons to Sinai is not unlike the call currently going out the church. It is a sound for assembly, and it is drawing hearts from everywhere to the mountain of the Lord. This call will refine and reveal our faith, but it will also produce another important outcome ? Unity!<br /><br />When the Lord speaks, it is most often a remnant who respond to the call. A ?mixed multitude? went up with Israel, which undoubtedly included some Egyptians. At the same time there was very likely resistance within Israel itself. These were leery of this journey and unconvinced that it was even necessary. These would be ready to return to Egypt at the first sign of trouble. This inclination would be revealed and judged during the journey. Likewise, there is a call to the church to lay hold of a promise. It is a promise of unity and authority to take the land. However, not everyone is hearing the call, and not everyone is committed to the cost.<br /><br />Those who will not hear have dull ears. Often they will hide behind a request for more clarity or information. Before the Lord, this is never an appropriate excuse. The king of Israel was rebuked by the prophet for not striking the arrows more often on the ground and was judged. Surely the prophet could have clarified beforehand the need to strike hard and often. But the king?s response was a response of the heart. His lack of understanding was rooted in a hidden pride and unbelief. Information is never really the issue.<br /><br />For those who wish to live in the spirit there is a ?<em>deep which calls to deep at the noise of Your waterfall</em>? (Psalm 42:7). We cannot quantify it, but there is a yearning for something we cannot fully express. We know we are journeying and looking for the One who draws. However, defining with words what it is we seek is not entirely possible. On the other hand, when we encounter those who have heard the trumpet sound, there is a natural affinity between us. Our spirits burn within us as we share, and we know we seek the same things. Explanations are not necessary because we learn to live by the witness deep within us.<br /><br />This is the trumpet call which Jesus was making. Those who believed they knew best resisted Him and demanded proof. But since they were determined not to hear, it was confusing and annoying. They questioned His authority and speculated about his aims, even as they considered his speech. Unfortunately for them, His words were beyond their understanding because they were spiritual. The Lord never tried to convince them by offering proof; rather, He rested in the truth that, \'<em>All who have heard the Father come to me</em>\'. (John 6:45)<br /><br />The things of the Spirit are spiritually discerned. But even when they are discerned or prophetically detected, ?<em>we see through a glass darkly</em>?. It is not until the thing which you vaguely saw is displayed before you or described by others that you rise and say, ?Yes! This is it!? In the same manner, we become joined to others of like spirit who have heard the rumblings of the waterfall and so seek a city whose builder and maker is God. We have found such who are of the same spirit, and the cry of our hearts is ?<em>Come and let us go up to the mountain of the Lord, to the house of the God of Jacob...</em>? (Isaiah 2:3)</span><span style=\'font-family: Times New Roman; color: #000000; font-size: small;\'> </span></p>'),(39,'Beyond the Root - I','<p />It is a rare thing to find someone who does not carry emotional baggage.  This baggage in turn has a debilitating effect on relationships both in christian and non-christian circles.  Despite advances in emotional healing and deliverance, believers often seem far from being whole.  How can the Church be entrusted to save cities and nations when believers are no more healthy than their unredeemed counterparts?  In an attempt to deal with the problem much has been said regarding roots; that is roots of bitterness and rejection. The question we must ask ourselves is this:\n\nAre emotional problems the key issue, or is it simply a symptom of the actual problem?  If they are merely a symptom then our quest for wholeness must take us \'Beyond the root\'.</p>\n<h4>The Root of the Problem</h4>\n<p>The analogy of plant growth is relevant and scriptural.  Paul warns against a root of bitterness while Jesus likened us to soil in which weeds( thorns and thistle) might grow.  In Jeremiah there is a prophetic exhortation imploring us to \'avoid sowing among the thorns\'(Jeremiah 4:3).  What are the thorns?  They can represent many things depending on the context.  Concerning the soul, weeds, thorns and thistle stand for sin and the pain brought on by the ravages of the kingdom of darkness.  In the absence of a revelation of the Father\'s heart there can only be rejection, fear, loneliness and dissappointment.  These can inhibit our ability to form longlasting healthy relationships.</p>\n<p>Consequently, our attention has focused on two things: firstly, bringing a revelation of the Father\'s heart and secondly, weeding the soil of our soul with special attention being paid to the root.  Of course, as anyone who has done the least amount of gardening knows, getting rid of minute portions of a root can be next to impossible.  Likewise, complete healing seemed to contantly slip through the fingers of those we nurtured.  Having been impacted by clear demonstrations of power, believers achieved only short-term freedom before the weeds would again re-establish themselves.</p>\n<p>Initially I could not understand why so many failed to achieve spiritual and emotional stability.  One thing was certain, there was an answer! Increasingly, it began to be clear:  The weeds were not the problem.  The scripture declares that offenses will come.  Even Jesus was a \'rock of offense\', but he said, \'And blessed is he who is not offended because of Me\'. </p>\n<p>The true issue is not the fact others offend but the ease by which we are offended.  It is not the root or the sown seeds which should concern us most, but the soil which gives room for it to take root.  This is not to say we ignore the root, rather in our quest for wholeness we must remove the root, but also press on to change the constitution of the very soil in which it finds place.  Is it a coincidence that the garden of Eden contained no weeds or thistle before the fall of man?  Mankind\'s fall into sin brought the curse which included thorns and thistle (Genesis 3:18 )\'.  Previous to this moment the earth was immune. It simply could not or would not allow their seed to germinate.  Likewise, there is a place of immunity for the heart and soul of believers.  It begins with aggressive weeding, but that is just the beginning.  The process of my own healing is testimony to this truth.</p>\n<h4>Discovering the Problem</h4>\n<P />My personal desire for freedom in this area began very early as the Lord revealed the depth of my need.  I remember it as if it were yesterday.  It happened while I was a student at Christ for the Nations in Dallas, Texas.  Every day at 11:00 am we assembled in the main auditorium for Lectures in Contemporary Theology; a fancy name for a daily session hosted by various guest ministries.  I found these sessions enjoyable not only for the value of the teaching but because the entire student body assembled.  Being a social bug this gave me the opportunity to meet and chat with the broadest variety of people.  A veritable people smorgasborg (buffet to some)!</p>\n<p>As per usual, I proceeded to my seat anticipating some warm fellowship and the comfort of friendly faces.  On the way I passed by a friend who was engaged in casual conversation.  Giving him a broad smile and warm greeting as I passed by, I expected the same in return.  Instead I received a rather blank nod; barely an acknowledgment, I thought.  Immediately, hot streaks of anxiety flushed through my body.  Bewilderment and confusion flooded my being as I quickly summarized my recent history with this person.</p>\n<p>Questions pounded my mind with thunderous force.  \'What had I done?\'  \'Did I offend him?\'  \'Was there something I said which caused him to begin to dislike me?\'  In my mind I rehearsed yesterday\'s greeting; it was nothing short of raw excitment.  \'Why had today\'s greeting fallen so short of yesterday\'s, I wondered.  \'Surely something must be terribly wrong that he should snub me in such a callous manner\'.  Suddenly, amidst the blurr of my raging thoughts, reality pierced it\'s way into my being as the Lord spoke (though at the time I did not know it was the Lord).</p>\n<p>The word was as profound as it was simple.  He said , \'He was talking to someone else!\'. Stunned by this revelation I immediately relaxed.  \'Of course\', I thought, as this new clarity settled down upon me.  Though I was refreshed by the knowledge I was not being rejected, my response to this harmless interaction alarmed me.  How could I have missunderstood the situation and been overtaken with such an upheaval of emotion?  For the first time I saw my emotional response as significantly abnormal.  Even worse was the fact that this was a regular and typical response, though I had never before thought it unusual.  Up to that point I had begun to understand, to some degree at least, my need for healing.  However, I now saw myself in an entirely new catagory; neurotic.  That may not have been a clinical definition, but something was clearly wrong with me.</p>\n<h4>The Secret World</h4>\n<p>Some may find my response in this situation amazingly strange and wonder how someone could not be aware this was a problem.  Welcome to the secret inner world! While this topic would make a very good article in itself, let me briefly explain.  Each of us regularly engages in thinking processes which are unhealthy and sometimes unbelievably wicked.  However, our inner world is not subject to scrutiny.  The measures and standard applied to the outside world do not apply here.  The mind and heart regularly process judgements and determinations without the slightest bit of objectivity or accountability.  These are the strongholds which serve to advance the destructive abilities of the kingdom of darkness in our lives.</p>\n<p>So deeply entrenched are they, that they go on without our active consent or contribution.  Why?  Because they have never been questioned or brought to the light.  Unless we have opportunity to divulge them, which rarely happens unless we are assured of agreement, their protective custody continues unabated.  It begins early while we are raised in an environment which breeds and nurtures it\'s peculiar brand of thinking patterns.  It can be as simple as a belief that men should not show their emotions.  On the other hand it may be as devilish as systematic racism. Whatever those patterns are, throughout our lives they are communicated and reinforced by those closest to us.  We develop friendships with those who think like us, where we articulate deviant philosophies to a chorus of \'Amens\'.  They become so familiar to us we cannot even see them as distinct from who we are.  Since no one has the opportunity to observe or question these thoughts, they can never be challenged or changed. </p>\n<p>The first work of the Holy Spirit is to begin isolating these destructive patterns.  But they are more than patterns, they are demonic strongholds; places where our minds do not stand in agreement with truth.  Areas of thinking which sympathize with perverse darkness.  The first level of spiritual warfare is not with demonic hosts in the heavenlies, it is with the darkness dwelling within(2 Corinthians 10:4-5).  When there are strongholds in our minds and emotions, we have no ability to see them as wrong.  When they are triggered, normal reasoning temporarily goes out the window.  Freedom can come, but it hinges on our willingness to receive the truth as it is revealed.</p>'),(40,'Christianity in the Marketplace - I','<p>Far too often Christians seem to lack success in the market place.  Mediocre would not be an improper word to describe our current standing.  However, there is a market place anointing coming which will challenge the way we view the world and its economic systems.  This anointing is no less significant than what is being prepared for the Apostolic and Prophetic. </p>\n\n<p>It will empower the Church to flourish, both socially and economically.  This change will displace historical strongholds, particularly in areas of finance through a manifestation of the kingdom of God.  It will require embracing a fresh commitment to kingdom principles right in the market place.  Christians who do not believe the Lord enough to live out their Christianity in the fullest way, will continue to see financial prosperity and political influence slip from their grasp.  Those who press on to greater faith will witness dramatic shifts not only for individual favor, but for an increase in financial and political power. </p>\n<p>The Spiritual and the Natural One of the first steps toward this shift will require a change in our understanding of the natural and spiritual realms.  As it is today, many believers tend to view their lives separate and different compartments.  What we understand to be natural is viewed in one way, while spiritual things are for spiritual occasions.  We will often approach them as though they had little relevance to each other.  This leads to a duality wherein we believe one way but  consider it impractical for real life.  The work place is considered natural and somehow out of reach of spiritual realities!  Therefore, we rarely consider the application of spiritual principles, other than in an indirect way.  \'Church is church but business is business\', some would say.  Few things could be further from the truth. In reality, whether we find ourselves in what is perceived to be a natural or a spiritual situation, the spiritual realm is the dominant arena.  Nothing happens except by the exercise of dominion, via the kingdom of darkness or the kingdom of light.  The natural domain, where we do \'business\', is always subject to spiritual realities.  Unbelievers, who are ignorant of this fact, have actually been unknowingly trained into principles which pertain to this world.  What they cannot know, is that the world is dominated by demonic wisdom, which is contrary to the knowledge of God.  What is natural or common, is in fact in accordance to principles which empower the domain of darkness.  While they may never be directly involved in what might be considered occultic activity, the whole world continues to lie under the sway of the devil(1 John 5:19).  Consequently, without the power of the knowledge of God at work, men cannot help but walk by the natural course of this world, which is according to the Prince of the power of the air (Ephesians 2:2). </p>\n<p>What appears to be a exception of sorts, are those who despite not having experienced redemption, have a dimension of the law written in their hearts.  In their case they may be touched by elements of the knowledge of God of which they are unaware.   Even so, each and every day men consciously or unconsciously exercise a wisdom connected to a spiritual dominion.  That is why Jesus said, \'Whoever is not for me is against me\' (Matthew 12:30).  There is no requirement of conscious assent to be postured against the will of God and the expansion of His reign.  This is evident in Peter\'s stand against Jesus\' journey to the cross.  Though he thought himself to be helping, he was in fact siding with Satan.  The Lord did not consider this simply a misunderstanding but a very specific exercise of devilish wisdom, which he attributed to Satan himself. \'Get behind me, Satan!  You are an offense (snare) to Me, for you are not mindful of the things of God, but the things of men.\' (Matthew 16:23) </p>\n<p>Jesus made a clear connection between the thinking patterns of men and the kingdom of darkness.  He essentially suggested a synonymous relationship between the two.  The things of men are in themselves postured against the rule of God.  This means that thinking which is natural to men, is all that is necessary to advance the influence of the demonic.  The idea of a neutral middle ground called \'natural\' simply does not exist. James makes a similar bridge in James 3:15, by describing a certain thinking (wisdom) as being both earthly and demonic.  \'This wisdom does not descend from above, but is earthly, sensual, demonic.\'  The implications of this statement are far reaching. </p>\n<p>What might be considered \'normal business practice\', accepted and practiced by multitudes, may in fact be the exercise of spiritual power for selfish ends.  For example, what might be known in the world as the \'art of persuasion\' may actually be a form of \'natural\' witchcraft.  I call it \'natural\', because it has become an integral part of one\'s personality and mannerism.  But it is \'witchcraft\', in that it emerges from subtle manipulation.  It is really an extention of man\'s desire to control others by using principles which are \'of the earth\' and natural.  It may not involve the use of potions and incantations, but it still constitutes an illegitimate use of power. </p>\n<p>For the unsaved this is common and ordinary, but it is essentially spiritual in nature.  Though the bridge between the natural and the spiritual has been blurred, spiritual dynamics continue to be involved in day to day business life.  The only question for the believer is \'what principles will we invoke?\'.  And will we wake up to realize that these principles continue to make up the invisible sub-structure of the world as we know it.  Ignorance cannot negate reality.  And the reality of our world is that it is made up of those things which are unseen (Hebrews 11:3).  The Kingdom Dynamics By implication then, the only real way to obtain influence is by engaging the power of spiritual kingdoms.  The struggle between them is not limited to the lost souls of men, but by extension reaches into every dimension of daily existence. </p>\n<p>Consider these verses! \'But even if our gospel is veiled, it is veiled to those who are perishing, whose minds the god of this age has blinded, who do not believe, lest the light of the gospel of the glory of Christ, who is the image of God, should shine on them.\' (1 Corinthians 4:3)  \'...in humility correcting those who are in opposition, if God perhaps will grant them repentance, so that they may know the truth, and that they may come to their senses and escape the snare of the devil, having been taken captive by him to do his will.\' (2 Timothy 2:25-26) </p>\n<p>The suggestion is that mankind is unable to process information without the interference of spiritual forces.  They are \'taken captive by the will of the devil\' and are unable to come to their \'senses\'.  Meaning, the potential exists to be manipulated in every conceivable way.    In other words, the same factors which keeps people from being saved, influences their decisions on matters of economics, or opinions about who might best fill an opening in the foreign sales department.  Unfortunately, this is not always obvious but happens as a normal part of life\'s routine.  As a consequence, those who deserve recognition do not automatically receive it.  Since hidden factors determine who is perceived as responsible for both success and failure, hard work becomes less important than being able to commandeer the perceptions of others.  Those who rise to the top may have excellent work habits and skill, but will possess an additional dimension.  Whether they are aware of it or not, it is spiritual in nature. </p>\n<p>The authority of the spirit realm overshadows everything!  For some, this may come as a revolutionary idea.  Nevertheless, the reality stands that those decisions which affect the outcome of careers, appointments and promotions are less connected to merit than they are to the exercises of spiritual influences.  Perhaps some of us were under the impression our work place was somehow immune to the life and death struggle which occupies the attention of heaven and hell.  On the other hand it is more likely that we just had not thought about it.  However as it reads in scripture, \'Let God be true and every man a liar\' (Romans 3:4).  And regardless of our understanding the world is what it is.  In that sense we live in a two dimensional world in which all outcomes have their roots in the exercise of kingdom principles, either for the purpose of God or not.  If there is a middle ground of sorts, it is not in the neutrality of natural elements,  like the lunch room or seniority system in the union.  No, the only middle ground is a wilderness of mediocrity found in the lives of those who are making a transition into the kingdom of God.  That is, they have tasted of the redeeming power of knowing Christ, but like Peter their mindset lends itself very intermittently to the Kingdom of God. Going Through the Wilderness This concept is depicted in the lives of the Hebrews who wandered in the wilderness; on the one hand sustained by the providence of God, while at the same time limited to the subsistence of manna.  These have left the provisions of Egypt without having fully inherited the land of promise.  In this way, the Egypt and Canaan depict the two kingdoms.  Egypt had it\'s garlic, melons and fish (Numbers 11:5) while houses, lands and copious amounts of fruit waited in Canaan.  Each offers a land of promise, though of course, bondage accompanied the dainties of Egypt. </p>\n<p>The further you identify with one or the other, the more of its promises you receive.  On the other hand, those who waffle in between, experience little of either.  Hence, mediocrity becomes the staple of the day, until by faith there is an imposition of heavenly values on an otherwise demonically dominated world. We do not suggest that those who find themselves in the middle are any less committed to the kingdom of God.  Yet, once we are born into it, we are now on a journey which will bring us to maturity.  Maturity is the place where we are no longer subject to the laws and principles of the domain of darkness but, by faith, are walking in a continuous exercise of the power of God. We are on a journey in which we are being trained to bring the kingdom of God.  That is, there is a favor which the Father longs to bestow upon us, but like the conquest of Canaan, we enter it by faith. </p>\n<p>One of the first critical steps requires us to realize the nature of the combat.  Initially, the Hebrews refused to enter, measuring only numbers and size.  They looked only at the natural parameters and could not see themselves inheriting the land.  However, it is not the natural factors which determine victory, but rather it is spiritual factors.  The natural view of the world tells us that if we work hard and are diligent, we will be rewarded.  The spiritual reality is, we face a world dominated by demonic forces.  This demonic hierarchy will only yield to those who yoke themselves together with them (knowingly or in ignorance), or when forced by the imposition of spiritual force. </p>\n<p>Today, the hierarchy of demonic power is firmly entrenched in the corridors of the corporate and political world.  Besides the souls of lost individuals, the very structures which make for financial reward and career advancement , are also bound up.   But as Canaan was promised to the Hebrews, these are treasures which make up the inheritance of the saints.  The only way we will lay hold of our inheritance, is through the forceful imposition of the kingdom of God.  This alone can displace the influence of darkness.  Believers need to know that the treasures of darkness are carefully guarded and will not willingly yield themselves.  <br />The plundering of Egyptian wealth did not take place until the there had been a thorough and complete exercise of the power of the kingdom of God.  The Hebrews could not enjoy the fruit of Canaan until they, through obedient struggle, conquered the land.  Likewise, there must be a deliberate exercise of divine power and wisdom for the end time Church.  Those who truly understand this, will be given a sickle which will cause the wealth of the wicked to be inherited by the righteous.</p>'),(41,'Christianity in the Marketplace - II','<p>North Americans have been caught up in a reality TV show craze.  One particular series began with a couple of dozen people isolated on a remote island.  Through a series of competitions and events they were either rewarded or voted off the island.  The final contestant would win one million dollars.  What began as a game quickly became a microcosm of real life.  In the end one of the most methodical manipulators won.  To the astonishment of the viewing public the least deserving individual was the last man standing.  How could the island participants have allowed this to happen?  Given a chance the viewing public would never have voted this way.  Unlike the participants, the viewer had an insider look into the plotting and deception.  Thus, they had a more accurate perspective of the man.  Unfortunately, the participants themselves could only see those parts he chose to reveal.  This meant that the one most gifted in deception and illusion was able to win the game.</p>\n\n<p>Even though this was a game, it is a picture of the scenario being played out in the market place each and every day.  In the pattern of survivor, skillful manipulators charm their way through life, reaping many rewards they do not deserve.  In the game called life, illusion is everything, and reality becomes what we can convince others it is.  Whether they know it or not, those who excel, are actually navigating in principles native to the kingdom of darkness.  What they are engaging in, is a level of witchcraft which brings success by supernatural means. </p>\n<p>If the Christian community wishes to have influence in the market place, it must somehow bring clarity into the work place.  There must come an expression of light which makes everything self-evident and renders deception powerless.  When people are wandering in the darkness they can make themselves out to be anything they wish.  But when the light is turned on no one is deceived.  This is what we are called to do Ð to suspend the fog-like illusion which makes the world go around.  When we can successfully do that, we will have brought an expression of the rule of God into the market place. </p>\n<h4>The Advancing Kingdom</h4>\n<p>The believing community is aware that the knowledge of the glory of the Lord will fill the earth.  What we may not know is that the knowledge of the Lord is the light which makes things clear.  The judgment seat of Christ for example is described as a time when \'all things will be clear\' (1 Corinthians 3:13).  This is why Jesus declared Himself to be the Light of the World.  He was bringing an expression of the Father which exposed the hidden things.  In His presence the Pharisees, who were exceptionally gifted at hiding, could no longer conceal themselves and were revealed for hypocrites.  In turn He challenged them with the words, \'Which of you convinces me of sin\' (John 8:46).  In other words I welcome you to bring a greater clarity to my life than I am already walking in.  They could not and would not.  As a result of this power working through Him, He impacted every sphere of society.</p>\n<p>Likewise the Church is called to move with an authority which reaches into the market place.  It is an authority based on our willingness to walk in the light.  Even now a new threshold of combat between the kingdom of God and the kingdom of darkness is brewing.  We are being challenged to discover the authority given by God to His offspring.  When we have it, we will be empowered to take the fight against our enemy with a new comprehension of our spiritual weaponry.  Instead of always being on the defensive we will advance.  The fight we bring is not with human strength, but a manifestation of the glory and power of the kingdom of God.  We have not come to fight darkness with our passions and desires, but by the simple clarity found in truth.  As Paul wrote, by the manifestation of the truth we commend ourselves(2 Corinthians 4:2).  While the world seeks to commend itself through deception, we will walk in the light as He is in the light. <br />We might think of this in terms of gospel preaching and miracles, which certainly is one component of the kingdom\'s advance we want to see increase.  But there is another expression of the kingdom which is more subtle but amazingly effective.  It does not always require words because it consists of being and not doing.  <br />Jesus distinguished Himself from the Pharisees by being real.  This is a part of what it means to walk in the light.  The best way to show a forgery is to possess the real item.  Likewise the best way to make clear what is fake is by being real.  This is what the Lord is doing in and through us.  Making us so real and transparent, and yet filled with His love, that everything else pales in comparison.  Since deceivers are busy pretending to be something they are not, and thereby gaining favor they do not deserve, the manifestation of the real will suspend this form of injustice.  Today, unrighteousness is rewarded because it is concealed behind a mask of deception.  When unrighteousness is seen for what it is, it will no longer be rewarded.</p>\n<p>The question we need to ask ourselves is \'how much light do we carry?\'.  We can spend countless hours cursing the darkness and bemoaning the lack of righteousness in the world.  But if righteousness is measured in light and we have become the light of the world, who ultimately is responsible.  Our primary orientation must be a quest to be so much like Jesus that our impact is identical to His.</p>\n<h4>The Nature of the Battle</h4>\n<p>If we have understood the present state of creation, we know there is a continual wrestling for influence.  The world is ruled by spiritual forces and the only question is which one presently dominates the situation we find ourselves in.  Ultimately of course, we know we win, however, until that time there are continuous expressions of the kingdom of darkness which must be confronted.  One of the characteristics of that influence is found in the absence of justice. We don\'t have to live very long before we discover life is not fair.  People get things even when they do not deserve them.  That\'s not sour grapes, it just happens to be true.  The question is how and why does this happen, and what can we do about it?</p>\n<p>Paul tells us that our warfare is not against flesh and blood, and that we have spiritual weapons with which to fight(2 Corinthians 1):3-4).  We need spiritual weapons because we battle a mystical source of influence which determines who succeeds.  It is prevalent throughout the whole of creation and is therefore just as relevant in the board room as it is in the prayer room.  Commitment, hard work and talent are important keys for advancement, but it would be naive for us to think they are sufficient.  The true source of victory is spiritual in nature and come from the spheres of light or darkness.</p>\n<p>Consequently the market place is dominated by the principles of darkness driven by the lust for control.  The expressions of this quest for power takes many forms.  Some are obvious while others are less so.  It might surprise some to know it is the least obvious which are the most dangerous.  The real challenge are those devices which appear good on the surface.  These are the ones which rule the most powerful arenas of life.  The ability to deceive and passively manipulate have therefore become the world\'s most treasured commodities.  This is not limited to what we might think are the uncivilized portions of the world.  It is the unwritten law which governs every sphere of society in every nation of the earth.  In fact, darkness takes on its most deceptive forms under the shadow of relative military and political calm. </p>\n<p>Nevertheless, it is presently under siege.  The book of Revelations declares \'the kingdoms of this world have become the kingdoms of our Lord and of His Christ\'(Revelation 11:15).  Increasing inroads are being made as the promise to the meek begins to be fulfilled.  \'Blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit the earth\'(Matthew 5:5).  But how then do the meek supersede the ambitious?  How can the gentle overthrow the violent?  It will take a greater but opposite force.  Simply put, \'our weapons are not carnal and mighty through God to the pulling down of strongholds\'(2 Corinthians 10:4). </p>\n<p>Since the world we live in is ruled by power, it will take power to overcome it.  Not physical strength; not the power of money; not good looks, but a higher form of power, which is capable of displacing or negating all other influences.  Possibly with this in mind Paul wrote that \'the kingdom of God is not in word or deed but in power\'(1 Corinthians 4:20).  It is not what is said or what is done which counts.  It is the power within those things which makes the difference.  This is the reason two people can use the same arguments with identical words, yet with extremely different outcomes.  It is not the words we use but the amount of power behind them.  Words are mere containers empowered with a degree of either light or darkness. <br />Surely we have witnessed or ourselves been the victim of someone who could immobilize us with a phrase.  Afterwards you can think of twenty things you should have said, but at the time, it was as though temporary paralysis set in.  This is not the work of mere words, this is the product of spiritual power.  Those who move in this power will have dominion.</p>\n<p>Pagan peoples have known about this for eons.   Unlike us enlightened westerners - a term I use in jest - they regard people in terms of their \'magic\' or \'juju\'.  The scoffing intellectual, who may wish to dismiss this as vain superstition, is only parading his ignorance.  While there is no doubt that there is a great deal of meaningless dribble passing itself as cultural wisdom, the premise of a world governed by magic or power is accurate.</p>\n<h4>Natural Witchcraft</h4>\n<p>As usual though, all things are not as they would appear.  For while the average western intellectual would not admit to a belief in magic, the truth is he is a believer.  Western society operates on a similar framework of understanding and is no different than less technologically advanced societies.  We also measure people by their spiritual power, we have simply called it something else. We use words which sound more earthy but which, in the end, will prove to be entirely the same as magic and juju - words like charisma, charm, and star quality.  The fact that we use a different vocabulary cannot change reality.</p>\n<p>Even the word charm carries a spiritual tone.  After its initial definition of \'to affect by magic\' it means, \'to please, sooth or delight by compelling attraction\'.  I dare say the enticement to sooth or delight with compelling attraction is almost the motto of our western society.  Indeed, several industries are built around it.</p>\n<p>Now some may think the ability to produce \'compelling attraction\' has something to do with appearance.  Honestly speaking, having an attractive appearance cannot hurt.  But it is the ability and disposition to \'sooth and delight by compelling attraction\' which determines ones power.  Those who yearn very deeply to have this power, will at some point make a deliberate exercise of \'charming\', in order to gain favor.  This is the middle ground in the journey towards systematic witchcraft.</p>\n<p>To understand the insidious nature of \'seeking to delight with compelling attraction\' we only have to consider what is behind it.  Question:  Is it open, clear, truthful and honest?  The answer is too obvious.  At its root it is deceptive, selfish and insincere.  It is not only a lie, but an incredibly calculated and deliberate effort to beguile.  In fact the ability to appear aloof, professing a lack of design or desire is a significant part of the game.  The more one can appear disinterested the better.  All of which, by strange coincidence, happens to be rudimentary components of the kingdom of darkness.  James who wrote, \'For where envy and self-seeking exist, confusion and every evil thing are there\'(3:16).  Envy and the exercise of selfishness are the root of many other expressions of darkness.  Those who choose to give expression to their ambitions are in fact invoking powers of darkness.  Systematic witchcraft and the occult are simply the expression this same darkness takes once it has come to a place of maturity.</p>\n<p>But why is it difficult for us to consider it magic or witchcraft?  The answer is found, to some degree, in our ignorance of the nature of witchcraft. Regardless, natural witchcraft is present whether we choose to recognize it or not.  And when we use words like charisma or stage presence, we are indirectly referring to an unusual power some people carry.  It is a substance which cannot be isolated or defined because it has spiritual origins.  In the end it is this influence, which rules the world.</p>\n<h4>Contemporary Examples</h4>\n<p>Competitions on every level make use of magic at least as much as they do ability.  This was evident and clearly depicted on a local television program recently.  The program was a contest for young women, competing for a position in a musical group.  Each of the contestants were gifted singers and performers, several dozen of which had sufficient ability to fit the role.  However, when making the final determinations, the judges selection criteria shifted to a peculiar place.  Once it had been determined that each of the finalists were suitable in terms of talent, the selections began to take on a more ethereal flavor.  All of a sudden they began to use words like charisma, energy and star quality.  While skill was a factor, the feature which made the difference between success and failure, was a mystical quality which some had in abundance, others had a limited supply.</p>\n<p>I had not seen the previous programs but in discussing it with someone who did another interesting fact came out.  During a previous critical rehearsal one of the young ladies performed terribly.  According to the structure of the contest she should then have been passed over, but was not.  The judges chose her to move on, not because of her demonstrated abilities, but because they \'believed she possessed something\'.  That \'something\' is exactly what we are talking about.  It gives one the power to have favor where others do not.  The favor comes from outside the boundaries of merit and actual performance.  How does one gauge this ability? What is it and where does it come from?  Clearly it is not natural.  As was stated earlier - the world is ruled by spiritual power. </p>\n<p>Recently after sharing some thoughts on this with a friend he related to me a similar story.  His daughter had been competing in a speech contest for her school.  She had made it to the finals and seemed a clear winner.  Other students and adults who heard the finalists assured her she had won.  To most onlookers there was a great gap in the quality of speaking between her and the other finalist.  The strength of her delivery was better and the content was much stronger.  In fact, while his daughter had delivered her speech flawlessly, the other girl, lost her place several times and was obliged to restart.  However, she possessed a certain charm and stage presence, which seemed to negate all questions of merit.  Against all odds she won.</p>\n<p>What power is this which seems to be able to set aside rational thinking?  How do we define a mystical ability which can cause people to forget defects and remember only occasional moments of greatness.  Whatever we may wish to call it, it apparently acts as a cloak, enveloping an individual so as to conceal their faults.  This is a component of demonic glory - a counterfeit to the glory we share in with Christ.</p>\n<p>It is a spiritual power which comes from knowingly or unknowingly engaging in the practice of deception.  Granted, some seem to be born with copious amounts of it.  But is also something which is deepened by exercise.  Whether done in ignorance or with active consent, it relates to principles which empower darkness.  In effect it brings one increasingly into alliance with the father of liars. </p>\n<p>But is it something we might encounter only very occasionally?  To answer that we have but to consider how often we have heard abstract language; \'I don\'t know what it is, but there is just something about him\'.  People commonly refer to a non-specific, invisible quality which some possess in greater quantities than others. </p>\n<p>Our reluctance to consider it spiritual is a virtue of the blindness which comes from intellectual pride.  Magic is exactly what it is!  There may not be potions or incantations, but that is not what defines witchcraft.  The word \'witch\' is designated as one able to \'influence or beguile with allure or charm\'.  Witchcraft is said to be, besides the use of sorcery, \'an irresistible influence or fascination, enchantment\'.  At its root witchcraft is composed of two things:  Illusion and the need to control or be the center.  And while one may consider it only human to want to affect the environment one lives in, the question is one of means.  Which brings us again to the circumstance we face in the world - an invisible tension between two spiritual domains.</p>\n<h4>Understanding Our Source</h4>\n<p>These two domains both deal in power but differ in nature.  One relies on a reality rooted in truth while the other emerges from deception.  When a lie is sustained unrighteousness is empowered.  Conversely, the empowered delivery of truth(light) is the kingdom of God.  This is why John records the coming of Jesus as light shining in the darkness.  \'And the light shines in the darkness, and the darkness did not comprehend it\'(John 1:5)  The word \'comprehend\' can be translated as \'to seize, or lay hold of\', suggesting darkness is powerless when truth really shines. </p>\n<p>Thus the two kingdoms are known by the source from which they come.  It is not the label which counts but the substance within.  Are we of the light or of the darkness?  Knowing what behaviors belong to which domain is critical for the believer seeking a purer expression of God.  We must become aware of what spirit we are moving in if we mean to be effective for the Lord.  When our works are tainted by a form of deception, it suggests a need for change.  Either we must change the label or change the substance.  Satan is called the \'father of liars\' making him the master of both the lies and the liars.  This means that one of the first orders of business for believers is becoming free from those things which belong to darkness.  Only then can we hope to fight an effective battle. </p>\n<p>If the believing community wishes to have more than a marginal impact in life, we must begin to compete in the realm which counts the most Ð the spirit realm.  An emphasis on excellence and integrity is a great beginning, but to really influence our world we must walk in a market place anointing.  Without flowing in kingdom principles there will continue to be a lot of effort, followed by frustration.  Bringing a knife to a gun fight will put one at a clear disadvantage.  Dominion requires kingdom authority operating not only in the context of intercession or church worship, but as a feature of our day to day business dealings.  For what we have called the \'secular world\' is subject to either the kingdom of God or the kingdom of darkness.  By either the absence or presence of light we determine which one comes into play.  Beginning now, we must begin to see the world not as Satan\'s playground, but as the Lord\'s inheritance, prepared for and purchased by Him. </p>'),(42,'Christianity in the Marketplace - III','<p>The market place is an environment on which Satan desperately wishes to maintain his grasp. Thus far, as a master of illusion, he has succeeded in glorious fashion. His deceptions have enabled him to escape exposure and destruction, even when the Church was moving with great authority. With this in mind we need to approach the market place with great wisdom and discernment. Jesus admonished us to count the cost saying ?an army does not go to war without knowing something of the adversary it will face?(Luke 14:31). This admonition is particularly relevant to this battle. For if we hope to impact the business community we must consider the strongholds underlying the whole of our western society. It would be foolish to charge onto a battlefield without knowing where our enemy is postured, ie. ?what are his strengths, position and strategies.? The most serious mistake we could make is to find ourselves flanked and fighting a battle on two sides. Unfortunately this has been happening repeatedly and we are now just beginning to discern the origin of these assaults.</p>\n\n<h4>Half Measures</h4>\n<p>The mistake which has been repeatedly made by us is one of half measures. The situation is not unlike a scene from the Jurassic Park movie where the park warden hunts an escaped raptor. He thought himself familiar enough with the raptor?s nature, only to realize he had underestimated it?s keenness. And while he focused on the one, another quietly waited on the side for the opportune moment to strike. Once the hunter was committed in his focus, the trap was sprung. </p>\n<p>Likewise we find ourselves hunting malevolent forces, insidiously postured to resist righteousness at every turn. While we focus on our most obvious enemy, another foe, covertly hidden, waits to attack our flank. But what or who is this enemy? Our thoughts might immediately turn to images of homosexuality, abortion, or rampant lawlessness. But while these are obviously important issues for believers, they make up only a part of the problem. In fact, a key component of the enemy?s scheme lures us into thinking that obvious sin constitutes the whole of our objective. It is part of an elaborate illusion designed to occupy and distract us from a more complete victory. Meanwhile the enemy?s ?Trojan Horse? is passed over and sometimes openly accepted into our camp. </p>\n<p>Historically, the gospel has been used to target what we could call the symptoms of death, of which there are two sides. Unfortunately, the root cause and source is left to thrive again and again. While we focus on the evil men do, her twin sister waits quietly on the side preparing to foil our assault. The name of that twin sister is ?the good men do?. The greatest challenge we face is not obvious evil but hidden wickedness ? the Bible calls it the knowledge of good. It consists of all the right things men do to measure up to a superficial notion of righteousness. So long as believers remain sentimentally attached to mankind?s feeble efforts at goodness, the cycle of death will continue.</p>\n<h4>The Knowledge of Good and Evil</h4>\n<p>Death was introduced to the creation when Adam and Eve ate of the tree God forbade them to eat. The error was not only in disobeying, but the fact that the tree contained death. They were warned against eating at the cost of death, ?And you shall surely die...?(Genesis 3) Even so, the name of the tree was not the tree of death ? though perhaps that might have been suitable. It was called the tree of the knowledge of good and evil! It was not just the knowledge of evil, but the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. Rick Joyner?s book, ?There Were Two Trees?, deals thoroughly with this issue revealing the nature of our daily spiritual conflict. It is not a struggle between good and evil but a struggle between life and death.  <br />Good and evil are actually two sides of the same coin ? that coin is death. The good side of the coin is a distraction which causes us to reason away its danger. Eve looked on it and ate because it was ?good for food, pleasant to the eyes, and able to make one wise?(Genesis 3:6). We have continued to do the same thing in the church, tolerating death because it is in some way pleasant or sounds like wisdom. The key to overcoming it is realizing that the good and the evil are in reality one and same. Distinguishing between them is a total waste of time and energy.</p>\n<p>The oneness of good and evil is illustrated in the Star Wars series. The ?force?, an invisible impersonal power, which seems to have volition without personality, is said to have two expressions. Those caught on the dark side war against those on the good side. In reality, this is our present situation. But there is another force outside of the force. It is found in the dimension and expression of God and His kingdom. Creation is embroiled and enslaved by death(the force), fighting with itself under mistaken notions of good and evil; men in conflict with one another and each consider themselves good and their adversaries evil. The truth is neither of them are superior to the other. While these two expressions may seem different to man, they are actually one in the same. </p>\n<p>For the church to become effective it must be free from either side. It must come to market place with Life, the very Word spoken by God. Not even our interpretation of what God wants is sufficient, but as Jesus said, speaking Truth and Life(John 6:63). Becoming effective in our war against death means being able to make the distinction between life and death. </p>\n<p>When we presume to fight for God by eliminating the knowledge of evil and leaving the good, we are only dealing with half of the tree. This is an awful lot like dealing with half of a weed ? it is bound to spread its roots and grow back. Defeating this enemy requires we deal with the entire root. Furthermore, we need to know the remedy for death which is, of course, Life.</p>\n<h4>The Knowledge of God</h4>\n<p>Death in the form of good and evil came as a result of Adam and Eve?s disobedience. This death was not immediate but inevitable, that is, they set in motion the principle of death. They unleashed a force which would produce more than actual physical dying. It was a spiritual force able to empower everything contrary to God, for God by definition is Life. The initial and immediate result was a corruption which enslaved the whole of creation. So comprehensive was this death that nothing escaped it?s defiling power. Since that moment the creation itself has longed to be free.</p>\n<p>?For the earnest expectation of the creation eagerly waits for the revealing of the sons of God. For the creation, was subjected to futility, not willingly but because of Him who subjected it in hope; because the creation itself also will be delivered from the bondage of the corruption into the glorious liberty of the children of God. For we know that the whole creation groans and labors with birth pangs together until now.? (Romans 8:19-22)</p>\n<p>The creation longs for the moment when it can taste the redemption which we have already received. It cannot be found in the knowledge of good or evil but in the knowledge of God. Somehow then, the creation is aware of the constraints of death and yearns for Life. It desires the manifestation of Christ(1 John 3:8) that it might partake of our freedom. The fullness of which will come when Jesus returns to judge the living and the dead. It seeks a time when, like the sons of God, it can experience the knowledge of God. It anticipates the promised moment when the knowledge of the glory of the Lord covers the earth as the waters cover the sea(Habakkuk 2:14). The only remedy for the knowledge of good and evil is the knowledge of God. </p>\n<p>It is in this light that we can see the deceptive power of the knowledge of good. It acts as a substitute or diversion from the knowledge of God. As long as the knowledge of the Lord remains hidden, the world cannot see the false for what it really is... death. Only the revelation of God, who Himself is the ultimate definition of actual good, can strip away the veneer of what can be called the ?beautiful side of evil?. The goal of the church is not to manifest the knowledge of good but Christ Himself. This is where redemption always begins.</p>\n<p>For the individual the born again experience is the knowledge of God(John 17:3) entering man to reverse the effect of death. Then, it becomes the aim of each believer to do what Jesus did, which was to reveal the Father. This is the most basic description of our strategy and the only means to make meaningful change in the business community. The power of the knowledge of God reverses the effects of the knowledge of good and evil(Ephesians 2:17-19, Colossians 1:9-11). </p>\n<p>The implications of this fact are many. Most significant in this is man?s inability to produce anything but the ?knowledge of good and evil?, which is death. This is the heart of the gospel which the ?good? people of Christ?s day rejected. No matter how sincere we might be, the best we can manufacture is something which looks good, but is entirely void of life. Meaning the good which comes from the knowledge of good is no better than the evil. They are in fact one and the same. </p>\n<p>Until the believing community fully realizes this, our influence will be marginal. So long as we tolerate the knowledge of good we are actually building what we are meant to remove. You cannot rid the garden of weeds by removing the clover and leaving the dandelions. </p>\n<p>If the church does effectively deal with the human good, it cannot deal with human evil. Jesus said, ?Satan cannot cast out Satan?, which is the underlying problem in our society. What is needed is a massive outpouring of the knowledge of God which cuts through the fabric of society, making a clear distinction, not between good and evil, but between life and death. So long as we continue to toil in the arena of good and evil, it will be two steps forward and three steps back.</p>\n<p>This may be a hard pill to swallow but it is the cornerstone of the gospel of Jesus Christ. It is the reason Jesus told Nicodemus he needed to be born again and the reason Paul wrote that ?all have fallen short of the glory of God?(Romans 3:23).</p>\n<h4>Sin as a Disease</h2>\n<p>Through Adam and Eve we have all inherited a deadly disease from which there is no escape. Without exception each and every offspring contracts the disease. The only difference from one to the other is the ability to hide the disease. The sum total of human righteousness is concealment, which is no righteousness at all. For while some are able to conceal the symptoms of the disease, no one is less infected than any other. This is the current condition of the world we live in. </p>\n<p>To believe any differently leads to confusion regarding the state of the unredeemed. It leads believers to question the notion of man?s need for redemption, which in turns nullifies his ability and passion to evangelize. Today many believer?s hesitate to consider neighbors and co-workers as deserving of hell simply because they appear to be civilized and morally conservative responsible citizens. But if this were the criteria for heaven why did the Father bother sending Jesus? No, the fact is our society has come under the influence of the tenets of another religion, which reveres the good of man. As it so happens, this is not vastly different from the atmosphere of Judea in the days of Christ. In that day there was no nation, humanly speaking, as morally superior as the Jews. Yet, in the mind of Jesus, they were desperately in need of redemption. </p>\n<p>This was the message Jesus brought to the religious leaders of His day who were self disciplined and in control of themselves. He repudiated their goodness as being a veneer, which when under the right strains, would give way to violence and murder. He was not fooled by their ability to conceal hatred and envy. To him their appearance of godliness was an elaborate ruse, fabricated as part of a clever plan to gain dominion over others. His message was an utter condemnation of their religious hierarchy, which infuriated them into hysterical outbursts of rage. </p>\n<p>The secret of His effectiveness was in the fact that He did not compete on their level. He was not trying to outdo their supposed ?good?. Rather, His ministry was a revelation of the knowledge of God. A light shining in darkness which could not be overcome. Their outbursts were the human response exposed nakedness. Their hatred came from the realization that despite all their efforts, they could not raise themselves above the fray of the barbaric masses. Their fate would be identical to the worst of sinners, and to them, this knowledge was the unfathomable and unbearable. Their lives had been built on a lie they allowed themselves to believe. The lie said ?being able to hide the disease was equivalent to not having the disease at all?. Unfortunately for them, they had too much invested and could not turn back from it.</p>\n<p>Likewise, all mankind has become infected with a self centered ambition from which there is no escape. The name of the disease is the Knowledge of Good and Evil. The outcome is death! The primary condition of the disease is a compulsion to serve oneself. The ?self? of each and every human being has risen to the status of god and king. Escaping from this condition is simply not possible. The only question is one of expression. How will we subjugate others to our will? We can do that by being good or by being evil, or perhaps some combination of the two. And even if we manage to suppress the compulsion to have our own way, it is only that we may, like the Pharisee, feel superior to those who do not suppress it. Man is bound to serve self one way or another.</p>\n<p>This disposition is by nature hostile to God who is life. It cannot exude anything but death because it cannot and will not yield to the one who is Life. It expresses itself through a religion in which man himself is god. It can flirt with the notion of a creator but ultimately will not yield the center. While we might possess some ability to exercise this ambition positively, that cannot change what it is. Whichever side of the coin that is facing up does not determine what the coin is made from. </p>\n<h4>Dealing with the Good</h4>\n<p>But why is this understanding critical to impacting the market place? Simply put, you cannot get rid of a weed by destroying only half of its roots. Anyone who has done any amount of gardening knows the resilient nature of weeds. Unless you completely eradicate all the roots the weed will return. Likewise, until the church begins dealing with the knowledge of good it cannot successfully confront the kingdom of darkness. The rule of Satan is not only empowered by what is obviously wicked, it is strengthened by anything which originates from man. For which reason Jesus would do nothing unless He saw the Father doing it.  <br />Consequently, when we only target the knowledge of evil we actually facilitate another harvest of death via the knowledge of good. Jesus succeeded in that He did neither good or evil, but what the Father willed Him to do. The outcome was Life.</p>\n<p>Today the kingdom of darkness is being expressed in both the knowledge of evil and the knowledge of good. An assault on the kingdom of darkness therefore demands an assault on good as well as evil. We must be able to identify both. As it is many believers struggle with the idea of the unsaved middle class going to hell. This may never be openly articulated but it is an issue which lurks beneath the surface of Christendom. In fact it could be one of the reasons for our lackluster approach to evangelism. We secretly wonder how God could condemn to hell entire families of people who are clearly ?good? parents, ?good? neighbors, and ?good? citizens. Possibly we expect there will be some clause excusing socially responsible people. Yet, the scripture is clear! ?There is none righteous, no not one?(Romans 3:10). </p>\n<p>Now it is quite likely most believers are unprepared to ignore the Word of God. But the fact that we flirt with such an idea suggests a distinct problem. It begs the question ? how would we have dealt with the religious leaders of Christ?s day. These men who were so completely flawless pertaining to appearances but so thoroughly evil. Would we have been fooled or more importantly, are we being fooled today?</p>\n<p>The enemy is the deceptive power in what appears to be good. The greatest challenge is not cultivating intolerance for obvious evil, but an intolerance for good. In a civilized society such as ours, there is a cultural bent toward being nice. As such, ?niceness? becomes equivalent to righteousness. Yet, the reality contained in the gospel of Christ we are called to convey, is that the ?nice? are no closer to righteousness than the prostitute on skid row or the terrorist on the news.</p>\n<h4>The Key Stronghold</h4>\n<p>Which brings us to the question, ?What is the key stronghold of western society??. It is human righteousness! All things evil which appear good. This is the underlying ideology which empowers death in our land. Even the eastern terrorist groups have learned this fact. The Hizbullah and other such organizations now go to great lengths to put on a human face. Because in religious terms humanism is the worship of man. At its root it consists of a belief in the innate goodness of mankind. So whenever evil wishes acceptance in the west it has merely to use the language of human righteousness.</p>\n<p>As such the highest echelons of society are not dominated by the knowledge of evil but the knowledge of good. The business community, which holds the greatest concentration of social, political and economic power, is covered with a thin veneer of respectability which must be uncovered and confronted. And while in itself it is no more deadly than the knowledge of evil, it succeeds by virtue of its deceptive nature. <br />This is certainly evident in the arena of organized crime and is reflected in the history of some well known biker gangs. Recent news stories have brought to light the way they have changed. Whereas in the past they primarily consisted of low-life hoods, increased influence has birthed a degree of sophistication and a veneer of respectability. These changes in power have mirrored changes in image. This is not coincidence but a picture of the hidden hierarchy of darkness in the land. </p>\n<p>Meaning, in this society, the greatest concentration of evil is not expressed in what appears to be the worst places. Rather, the primary root of darkness in the land hides behind the illusion of propriety, kindness and goodwill, found in political and financial structures. And while we all know business and politics to be ruthless environments, the reality of this darkness has largely escaped the notice of the church. Thus, the first strategy of the believing community must be to gain an increased ability to define the demonic kingdom in all its forms. </p>\n<p>The foundation for doing this is found in the basic gospel and the truth that there is no righteousness aside from Christ. All that is in the world is the lust of the eye, the lust of the flesh, and the pride of life. Anything which appears otherwise is a lie and a deception. This means we must be guarded against the evil disguised as good, more than evil in plain view. When it comes to classifying darkness, obvious darkness is the least dangerous and the least powerful. And even Satan himself can come as an angel of light. </p>\n<h4>n Summary </h4>\n<p>The issue at stake is this: If we are going to penetrate the influence of darkness, we are going to have to know what that darkness looks like. Satan cannot cast out Satan. It is useless for us to bring a higher form of the ?knowledge of good? to compete with evil. They are one and the same. It is the righteousness which comes by faith, and the obedience to His good Word which will heal the land and penetrate the strongholds of this present darkness. It is a believing community which is not caught up in the battle between good and evil, but which sees the actual combat as being between Life and Death.</p>\n<p>The mindset of the Church must change. If we are to defeat death in all its forms we must not side with it, nor minimize its defiling power when it takes on a pleasant form. The knowledge of good must be taken as seriously as witchcraft and the occult. We must be able to see the hierarchy of demonic powers behind the corporate world. It is not simply propriety in business attire or the sophisticated system of exchange, it appears to be. The market places of the world are the veneer of guarded fortresses for the highest forms of spiritual darkness. While not necessarily evil in themselves, they are coveted seats of power for spiritual wickedness which wishes to ensnare and control. They wield financial power as well as carry political power and are therefore the object of envy and desire. The market place may look like a benign vacuum ? spiritually speaking. In reality, it houses the gateway to the secret reservoirs of darkness, which must become the possession of the Lord.  </p>'),(43,'Christianity in the Marketplace - IV','<p>The mandate of the Church is to preach the gospel of the kingdom. That message declares the imminent return of King Jesus who will reign over His purchased possession. Prophecy declares that ?of the increase of His government there will be no end?(Isaiah 9:7). This means there is no place the light of His glory will not shine. The light which began to shine some 2000 years ago increases in intensity to this very moment. As such, there is no realm of the universe and no sector of society which is immune to the power of His dominion. With this in mind and upon this assurance a new breed of Christian warrior will emerge to affect what has been commonly seen as the sphere of the secular.</p>\n\n<h4>Dread Warriors</h4>\n<p>In the recent past a well known prophet referred to a category of Christian soldier as ?Dread Warriors?. From what I remember of the reference, it spoke of a level of faith and courage which would accomplish what their title suggests. They will produce dread in their enemies, inflicting a constant anxiety and an unnerving expectation of defeat. The demonic world will anticipate their movement in much the same manner as the inhabitants of Jericho in the days of Joshua. At the time Rahab spoke to the spies saying ?the terror of you has fallen on us, and that all the inhabitants of the land are fainthearted because of you.? They had heard of the works the Lord had accomplished and were paralyzed at the thought of their coming. </p>\n<p>This Word will be fulfilled in many ways. Though it is not presently possible to know the many shades of fulfillment this word will bring, the unfolding promise is on the horizon and must be met with faith. One thing which is becoming clear is the fact that these dread champions will make their mark on both the marketplace as well as the Church. They will come in the spirit of David?s mighty men doing exploits for their God. Their mandate will not be to increase church membership roles, though that is an outcome which cannot be avoided. Instead, their focus will be to take the battle to the center of the enemies camp through a manifestation of the kingdom of heaven. </p>\n<p>Like Joel?s army they can be described as ?the like of whom has never been?(Joel 2:2). Indeed ?they run like mighty men, they climb the wall like men of war; every one marches in formation, and they do not break ranks.?(Joel 2:7). No stronghold of the enemy will stand before them and the very gates of hell will yield its spoil.</p>\n<p>The description of the army found in Joel 2:7 is especially important to notice. First it describes them as mighty men of war but goes on to say two important things: They will march in formation and not break rank. These two things are similar but prophetically speak of two different facets of a military advance. For example marching in formation has something to do with each member knowing his place while not breaking rank involves knowing the place of others. When we do not know our place we end up standing in the place of others. Not only will this cause confusion, but it points to the presence of envy and ambition. Competition and strife most often spring from a desire for an honor we believe is connected to a particular role. Such competition is contrary to the nature of the kingdom we propose to represent. As such, the training for dread champions includes removing those things which give place to envy and ambition. </p>\n<h4>Envy & Ambition</h4>\n<p>For those who have a vision to be part of this army, a call to a deep level of discipleship has come. The Spirit of God is working to root out ambition and envy, which is connect to the fear of man. The process is arduous and nothing short of the path Jesus followed to the cross. But it is these two primary drives ? the fear of man and ambition ? which compel men to compete and which are the source of strife in the world today.  <br />Understanding their relationship to each other is an important first step to being free. To begin with we should know they are one in the same but come from opposite spectrums. When closely examined it becomes clear that they bring about the same end. The only difference between them is that they work from opposite poles. For example, when we succumb to our own ambition we fall into the trap of defining ourselves by what we want. On the other hand, the fear of man will ensure we are defined by the ambitions of others. The one is bound to his own desire while the other is bound to the desires of others. Either way, the individual who is not free and cannot permit the Lord to define them. This is a key root which empowers the darkness. If not dealt with in the believer, the result will be an inability to remain in formation ? a condition which has allowed for countless defeats as many have become slaves to worldly and demonic forces. </p>\n<p>Dread warriors will not be limited in this way. They will be proverbial examples of Ephesians 2, they will be the workmanship of God and no other. This caliber of believer will know their place and role as defined by the grace of the Lord and not by their own selfish ambition or the ambitions of men. They will be ?volunteers in the day of His power?(Psalm 110:1) and ?the generation of Jacob who seek His face?(Psalm 24). <br />The second distinguishing feature of this warrior is that they will ?not break rank?. This relates to knowing their role in the army but suggests something more. It declares their unwavering commitment to others in the army and the army as a whole. Meaning, they will not allow their own need to distinguish themselves draw them into unnecessary conflict away from the larger body. They will have a broad revelation of the purposes of God rather than a fixation on their own ministry. As such they will not jeopardize the armies flank by moving from their post. They move as the army moves and not as individuals.</p>\n<p>In the era of warfare we are moving into, knowing ones distinct function will be a critical necessity. Seeing that happen will require a paradigm shift for us, as the parameters of what we call ?ministry?, will need to be enlarged and greatly diversified. Otherwise the expectation of the Kingdom of God emerging in such a way as to influence all economic, political and social structures, will not be realized. Traditional thinking of what constitutes a minister of the gospel must change. Indeed the Lord is about to reveal not only apostolic authority in the classical sense, but also a marketplace apostolic anointing. A fair and realistic title to this marketplace ministry could be Apostolic Entrepreneurship.</p>\n<h4>Apostolic Entrepreneurship</h4>\n<p>When entrepreneurship anointings are released, there is a trickle down aspect which affects more than one or two individuals. For example when we see a church with a prophetic anointing, it is not assumed that all are prophets. Rather, we are making an assessment of a dominant characteristic of the Lord?s presence a particular group of people might be carrying. Likewise, when the Apostolic ministries begin to come to maturity, and are recognized as such, we will see the evidence in the few and the many.</p>\n<p>As things presently stand, the Church is postured for revival and looking for a return to signs, wonders and miracles. This is right and definitely part of what is coming, but there is much more. The Father has been waiting for a generation who would allow Him to really roll up His sleeves and show Himself. Up to this point the Church has severely limited His creative genius. We let the Lord do a little but have lacked the faith necessary to give Him complete latitude to demonstrate His workmanship in the earth. This has not only limited our expectations of what He might do, but has hindered the type of believer He has desired to use. Why so we do this? Mostly, it is a matter of faith. It is always easier to do things in the realm of what we presently understand. Allowing someone to be something we cannot label or pigeon hole makes us feel uncomfortable. So as soon as the Lord begins to use someone we want to make them look like us. This has been a splinter in the heart of the Lord?s purposes which will be corrected.</p>\n<p>It reminds me of the woman who was frustrated at the efforts of her husband to change her. She said, ?He read that the two shall become one, and decided we should become him?. We are always tempted to make disciples in our own image instead of His. To remedy this the Lord is raising up Fathers whose hearts will be turned to the sons and not to themselves. They are those who bless the workmanship of the Lord and refuse to intervene except to cover and protect. </p>\n<h4>What is Ministry?</h4>\n<p>One of the chief areas we have resisted the Lord is in the way we define ministry. This is a problem which has existed since the beginning of the Church. Consequently, it has become a historical stronghold and is limiting our vision of what constitutes ?real ministry?. Paul, for example, was one who made his living through business while functioning as a premier Apostle. One of the things which hindered him was the perception of a gap between market place work and church ministry. Paul was forced to defend himself against accusations that he was not a real apostle. One of the charges had to do with the fact that he benefitted the Corinthian Church by choosing not to be a financial burden to them.</p>\n<p>Today there are many who feel this same tension. They stand at a crossroads between the market place and traditional ministry. Their passion for the kingdom steers them toward church but their heart is for the market place. There seems to be no paradigm which can include both. In addition, there is an unspoken belief that vocational ministry is a spiritually superior alternative. For those caught in this tension I can say there is a time coming when the need to distinguish one from the other will diminish. And while there remains an obvious and critical function for traditional ministry, many will rise up with significant stature from within the market place. </p>\n<p>Unfortunately, as things are, this is not yet the case. Instead there exists a climate of spiritual elitism with regard to traditional ministry. This coupled with the absence of any market place model has stiffled other possibilities. But perhaps we can begin to take aim at some of the hidden sources behind this spiritual elitism. The difficulty is that no one will admit to holding such attitudes. Therefore, we must dig a little deeper to detect its presence. There are subtle signals in the way we respond to people which can tell us a lot about our heart.</p>\n<p>For example, we should look for indications of hero worship. Meaning, an atmosphere where the pastor, the prophet, or anyone with status is treated with superior honor. When we automatically value spiritual input if it comes from one of these identities, we suggest title is more important than substance. </p>\n<p>Then there are the more subtle betrayals of hidden value systems. If someone suggests they have a ministry of any kind one of the first things we wish to ascertain is if they do this full-time. If they do not, the proverbial but clear message of ?Oooohh,...(pause)that?s nice?, is somewhat cryptic but speaks volumes. To the speaker and to all those within hearing it says, ?Sooo... your not a REAL minister!? Those who experience this subtle rejection are prone to want to define themselves in a way the people will accept . </p>\n<p>Unless a person is very secure in their identity it is easy to long to be something the Lord has not ordained. And again, this all happens while we all purport to believe that every single believer is a full-time minister for Christ, ie. we are all ambassadors. However true, such talk is often mere rhetoric given for the comfort of conscience. Meanwhile each of us holds to private prejudices communicating value and scorn in the tone of our attitudes. Unfortunately, one of primary places these attitudes are cultivated is in Bible College. It comes not by design but by default.</p>\n<p>The experience of many young believers at Bible College is similar to a military recruit going for basic training. Young green recruits will be overly impressed by the sergeant and will want to be just like him. In turn, the instructors who are more enamored with themselves, than committed to preparing soldiers, will use this situation for self promotion. While the stated purpose of basic training is to shape the recruits war, it is often suggested that serving a drill sergeant is the highest and best role to which a soldier can aspire. As applied to the church, it means young people are being given the idea that going to the market place is second best; a destiny of default for the unworthy. In the end many who were originally destined for the front lines of the market place are lured into vocational ministry. Those who go on to the market place do so without vision and often with a double mind fueled by remorse and regret. </p>\n<h4>The Fullness of Time</h4>\n<p>However the Lord is gracious to not let the story stop here. He has determined by His grace, a generation which will rise above yesterdays failures. There is a prophesied moment when the Lord bears His right arm of salvation; a time when His people are volunteers in a day of power. In that season the treasures of hidden wisdom will come to light and the concealed riches of secret places will be reclaimed. </p>\n<p>This has begun in limited jurisdictions, but we have only seen the tip of the iceberg. The Lord has reserved certain end time anointings which will revolutionize our understanding of ministry. As with the wine at the marriage of Canna He has saved the best for last. In the coming days we will see Evangelists, Prophets and Apostles of the most amazing stature. Alongside them will be anointings which will deal directly with the marketplace itself. What Paul was in establishing the early Church, these will be to the marketplace ? marketplace Apostles. Whatever title we might assign them is insignificant. What matters is seeing them released to fulfill their purpose.</p>\n<p>It is a Cyprus anointing ? a grace to pillage historic demonic strongholds, prophesied by Isaiah to the Persian King Cyprus. This same word is a prophetic picture of what will happen as we approach the Day of the Lord. <br />?Thus says the Lord to His anointed, to Cyprus, whose right hand I have held?to subdue nations before him and loose the armor of the kings, to open before him the double doors, so that the gates will not be shut: I will go before you and make the crooked places straight; I will break in pieces the gates of bronze and cut the bars of iron. I will give you the treasures of darkness and hidden riches of secret places, that you may know that I, the Lord, who call you by name am the God of Israel.? (Isaiah 45:1-3)</p>\n<p>This passage is the promise of a new breed of spiritual warrior whose main frame of reference is the marketplace and not the church. Their ministry is to bring an expression of the dominion of God into the places which have largely been untouched by the church. They are not businessmen, though their vocations will be in business. They are ministers whose sphere of ministry is not Sunday school, the pulpit or the early morning prayer meeting. Rather, they are called to the lions den to subdue those powers which bind the business financial worlds. </p>\n<p>The Lord has promised a mighty harvest in these end days. But no harvest will be complete until the powers which control the heart of the business community are unseated. Today demonic powers monopolize entire industries and spheres of finance. Their influence is not subtle or discreet, though it is intangible. Using the power of Mammon they control and subdue the will of the people. Principalities sit as kings ruling over vast economic empires dictating who and who will not share their power. But what they possess is not rightfully theirs, and they are about to be awakened to a prophetic reality. Neither the souls which they oppress nor the wealth they wield has ever been promised to them. And if the truth be known it has never actually been entirely in their control. But what does the Spirit say? </p>\n<p>??And I will shake all nations, and they shall come to the Desire of All Nations, and I will fill this temple with glory? says the Lord of hosts. ?The silver is Mine, and the gold is Mine, says the Lord of hosts?.? (Haggai 2:7-8)</p>\n<p>All these things belong to the Lord and to whom He wishes to grant it. But do not be misled into thinking this is about the acquisition of wealth. Those who are so motivated cannot share in this harvest. Rather it concerns the reclamation of the Lords dominion. It is He who gives the power to create wealth and not the forces of evil which presently dominate financial circles. These circles represent the treasures of darkness and hidden riches of secret places which today empower the reign of illegitimate authority. It includes wealth but speaks of the seats of influence themselves. </p>\n<h4>The Cyrus Mandate</h4>\n<p>To this end the Lord will release a Cyrus anointing to pillage the enemies storehouse. For what empowers governments ? spiritual or otherwise ? is not the type of administration or the extent of it?s geography, it is the storehouse?s of captured treasure. For far too long the enemy of our souls has held the gates of the church. Yet Jesus promised us an advance such that the very gates of hell would yield. Since the reformation Satan has been losing his grip, and in the unfolding days, even the gates which protect his historic domain will fall.</p>\n<p>King Cyprus was given authority to break the gates of bronze, cut iron bars, and to make the crooked places straight?. The first two speak of fortifications which are demonic in nature. The ?crooked places? are the devices in place which cause reward to go to the unrighteous. The advance of the kingdom of God means righteousness must prevail. There is an increase of his government which will not end, and that increase must come at the cost of another realm of authority. Thus, the increase must come directly into the territory of the enemy. </p>\n<p>Presently, there are barriers which shield the wealth laid up for the righteous which must be removed by an expression of the rule of God. This will take more than business savvy. It will require an obedience to the leading of the spirit and an understanding of the battle ahead. It will take the wielding of spiritual weaponry against an enemy who is not flesh and blood. This mandate is quite different than being one whose is blessed of the Lord. Today many believers in business prosper because they faithfully steward their gifts. This is wonderful to see, but the Cyrus anointing will fall upon an entirely different sort of individual. These are warriors with the heart of David, mighty men of grace who will do exploits. At this very moment, a generation of them are being prepared and will be launched, as carefully crafted arrows designed to hit the mark.</p>'),(44,'Deceptive Glory','<p>There is a glory in the world which tempts and calls to men.  It is a fleeting glimmer of power and fame, promising it\'s hosts a sense of value and importance.  In reality it is the most profound and devious deception in existence; it is nothing it appears to be.  When the veil between this present age and timeless reality is rent, the nations will gasp with horror.  Only then will they see the folly of their ambition and vanity.  For before their eyes will be clearly revealed the brilliant riches of Christ and the corruption of this world\'s passing limelight.  At that time men will writhe with shame as they behold the lie for which they sold their souls.</p>\n\n<h4>Glory</h4>\n<p>To such a world Jesus came with a mandate to birth a Kingdom, one of light and truth.  Until then only darkness filled the earth because men did what was right in their own eyes.  Terror, war and bloodshed fill human history because men have sought their own good.  Driven by an independent self-serving lust for glory and praise, they sought control of others.  Why?  Simply because men have a deep seeded need to be the center.  This hidden motive is the point at which the kingdom of God and the kingdom of darkness divide.  Jesus came to obtain a kingdom by denying himself glory, praise, and the right to control.  In so doing, He released the government of God; a Kingdom with God in the center.</p>\n<p>If you ever wondered what empowers the kingdom of darkness look no further than the heart of the individual man.  The nature of sinful man is self-serving causing him to continually seek \'glory\'.  Likewise, before I served the Lord, it was my wholesale ambition to command attention.  My lifestyle was a continual striving for the affections of those around me.  My clothing and behavior was geared to provoke attraction.  Success in sport became a chief means for capturing the gaze of approving eyes.  My \'glory\' came in the form of anything which could give me the \'limelight\'.</p>\n<p>Like many young boys I remember having \'hero\' fantasies.  Whatever language we want to use it amounts to the same thing.  It is usually a situation where we are the victor and the object of people\'s admiration and affection.  I dreamed of championship hockey games where I would score the over-time goal, leading my team to victory before a cheering and adoring crowd.  Basking in the glow of thunderous applause I would lift my hands in an act of celebration enjoying the moment of conquest,... the moment of glory.  The intensity of my imagination made it so real. I could see and feel it, and \'O how I longed for it\'.  But what is this desire for glory and where does it come from?</p>\n<p>The Greek word for glory is doxa.  Most of us think of it in terms of \'the glory of God\'.  That is, the glow of his glorious presence, or the whitehot flash of the essence of His power.  While it can represent these things when applied to God, it has a fairly generic definition.  It means: appearance, reputation, glory.  Zodhiates Greek Key Study says, it \'may denote appearance, form, aspect, that appearance of a person or thing which catches the eye or attracts attention, commanding recognition, looking like something; thus equivalent to splendor, brilliance, glory attracting the gaze...\'. </p>\n<p>This means is anything and everything can have \'glory\'.  Buildings, objects and people can all possess something which causes recognition to come to them.  For example a woman\'s long hair, the scripture says, is her glory (1 Cor. 11:15)  Whatever has splendor and brilliance can be \'glory\'; that which draws attention and focus is our glory.  Men and women can have physical or personality attributes which catch the eye and command recognition.  These in themselves are not a problem. But they can become a snare when used to satisfy a desire for more glory.  We can be motivated to amplify the amount of glory we receive by flaunting what we have.  This is the nature of sin which propels and empowers the kingdom of darkness.  When men seek glory they are making themselves the center.  For this reason Paul advocated modesty in dress.</p>\n<p>What we are really talking about is a form of worship.  When Satan fell it was because he envied the worship focused on God.  Likewise, this same desire continues to fuel human achievement to this day.  Of course we don\'t always see it that way, but the desire to be looked upon with adoration speaks of worship.  Men may not want the outward forms of homage associated with worship, but they would like to be revered.  The famous epic movie \'Ben Hur\' offers an interesting commentary on this dynamic.  It comes just after the great chariot race where Charleton Heston is honored by Pontius Pilate.  Before crowning him he says, \'You are the peoples one true god,... for the time being.  Permit us to worship,... I crown you their god!\'  Their \'foolish superstition\' may not have been very far from the truth. </p>\n<p>Today men create spheres of attention through sports, entertainment, and politics.  In the age of sophisticated enlightenment our heroes may not call themselves \'gods\', but what does that matter when we live by the same ambition to be in the center.  We mock the evil ambition of Hitler and Stalin, whereas the only difference is the size of our circle.  We simply graduate from one level to another never being fully content with our status.  One day we will see there is really only one circle, and there can be only one center.  Satan has blinded man by fragmenting and diversifying the ambition for glory, but it all has one source.  That source is the evil spiritual government we call the kingdom of darkness. Herein can we contrast the Kingdom of God from the Kingdom of Satan.  Mainly, that the Kingdom of Satan is strengthened and increased by the activity of \'seeking glory\'.  That is how it began, and that is how it continues.</p>\n<h4>The Fall</h4>\n<p>Before creation,... before the fall of man,... before Lucifer\'s sin,... God alone was the center.  All things flowed from Him and to Him.  He was the ultimate object of worship, whose glory continually captivated the attention of heaven.  He was the only center.  Nothing existed in His domain which did not automatically recognize His divine right to own the highest place.  Incredibly, in this very place the seeds of rebellion were born as one \'covering cherub\' named Lucifer, began to marvel at his own beauty.  Through Ezekiel the Holy Spirit testifies of his sin.</p>\n<p>\'You were the seal of perfection, full of wisdom and perfect in beauty. You were in Eden, the garden of God; Every precious stone was your covering: The sardius, topaz, and diamond, beryl, onyx, and jasper, sapphire, turquoise, and emerald with gold.  The workmanship of your timbrels and pipes was prepared for you on the day you were created. </p>\n<p>You were the anointed cherub who covers; I established you; you were on the holy mountain of God you walked back and forth in the midst of fiery stones.  You were perfect in your ways from the day you were created, till iniquity was found in you.</p>\n<p>By the abundance of your trading you became filled with violence within, and you sinned; therefore I cast you as a profane thing out of the mountain of God; and I destroyed you,  O covering cherub, from the midst of the fiery stones.  Your heart was lifted up because of your beauty; you corrupted your wisdom for the sake of your splendor;...\'(Ezekiel 28:12-17)</p>\n<p>Lucifer\'s error began when he focused on his own glory.  Even though it was something which God had flawlessly created it became a snare to him.  His heart became enthralled with himself to the point where he plotted the overthrow of God Himself.</p>\n<p>\'How you are fallen from heaven, O Lucifer, son of the morning!  How you are cut down to the ground, you who weakened the nations!  For you have said in your heart: \'I will ascend into heaven, I will exalt my throne above the stars of God; I will also sit on the mount of the congregation on the farthest sides of the north; I will ascend above the heights of the clouds, I will be like the Most High.\'\'(Isaiah 14:12-14)</p>\n<p>The rebellion of Lucifer was based on a desire to exalt and seek his own glory.  It began when Lucifer ceased to marvel at God and instead felt awe concerning himself.  The result is plain to see. The Kingdom of heaven was divided and one third of the angels were cast down.  Since that moment the powers of hell have continued to perpetuate the same vile program through men.  The program consists of inducing man to dwell on himself.  Wherever he succeeds there is division, hatred, violence and corruption.  Whether the circumstances include a church, a company, a family or a nation, the dynamics are identical.  Somewhere someone has become concerned about their own glory.</p>\n<p>One wonders how such a thing could happen in heaven.  How could an angelic being exposed to the wonders of God\'s unmatched glory surrender to such perverse wisdom?  It is simple when you understand God to be the ultimate center and the source of all life.  His very essence sustains what is good and decent. Whatever becomes disconnected from Him becomes corrupted.  Common sense disappears when God ceases to be the hub of the wheel.  When wisdom is not anchored in God, it wanders aimlessly into all that God is not.  The outcome can only be rebellion, pride and deception.  Therefore, yielding the center to Him in the fear of God, establishes the Kingdom on earth. </p>\n<h4>Glory to God</h4>\n<p>The Kingdom of God exists where men are rightly situated before God.  To live as though God were the continual object of our existence is to establish His government.  Thus, worship becomes a primary feature of the Christian life.  It enthrones God in the center!  However, our worship consists of far more than what we do in a corporate service.  It concerns the orientation of our heart in the matter of glory.  In this way Jesus succeeded where all others had failed.  Making His arrival not only the birth of the Son of God, but the birth of His Kingdom on earth.</p>\n<p>In Luke chapter 2 the angels appear to the shepherds in the field to herald the arrival of Christ declaring, \'Glory to God in the Highest\'.  The proclamation is a statement of inauguration: The Kingdom of God has come!  The significance of this phrase has largely escaped our notice.  It was far more than a sentimental thought.  It represents the advance of the Kingdom of God, saying, \'to God be the glory, and no one else\'.  More than a hymn of hope, it is a clear determination of the reality about to unfold before the creation.  God, through Jesus, was reconciling all things to Himself.</p>\n<p>Jesus understood the parameters of His calling.  He knew establishing His Father\'s Kingdom would mean dying to all need of glory.  His precedent showed us that it was not enough to be devout. Religious activity was not the designated sign posts of the Kingdom.  Rather, it was the daily yielding of His own will for the sake of the Father\'s glory.  As He prayed in the garden, His motto was always \'Not My will but Yours be done\'. <br />Our Lord\'s commitment to forsake all glory went beyond His lifestyle to the choice of Joseph and Mary as parents.  Their low estate was another way of turning His back on this world\'s glory. Instead of being born to a prestigious and powerful family in Jerusalem, He chose a manger in the countryside of Bethlehem!  And what about the physical condition of Jesus.  Isaiah says, \'He has no form or comeliness; and when we see Him, there is no beauty that we should desire Him\'(Isa. 53:2)  He could have been a strikingly beautiful man.  But the pattern of both his birth and life led toward the low road of obscurity.</p>\n<p>His commitment bound Him to saying nothing but what He heard the Father say.  He said, \'He that speaks of himself seeks his own glory (John 7:18).\'  He could not for a second trust His own thinking.  He understood the deceptive power of ambition and would not yield one moment to it.  This was the focus of the temptation in the wilderness.  Would He give in to the human desire to achieve glory? Would He worship Satan for all the glory in the world?  Would He jump from the pinnacle of the temple to inspire awe and prove Himself?  Would He perform a miracle outside of the leading of the Father?  More than denying Himself in the wilderness, He told people not to publicize His miracles.  He had no desire for the glory men could give Him.  In the spirit of lowliness and humility He said \'I seek not my own glory:...\' (John 8:50).</p>\n<h4>The Disciples</h4>\n<p>The pattern of Christ\'s walk was vital as it establishes a precedent.  All who suppose to release the Kingdom of God must follow His example.  In fact, to not do so makes one Christ\'s enemy. <br />\'For many walk, of whom I have told you often, and now tell you even weeping, that they are the enemies of the cross of Christ: whose end is destruction, whose God is their belly, and whose glory is in their shame, who mind earthly things.\'(Philippians 3:18-19)</p>\n<p>The pathway of the Kingdom is the cross of Jesus Christ.  If we are unsure what that means we can safely assume it means death.  Death to our desires for praise,... death to our need of reputation,... death to the egotistical need of control and acclaim.  All these things the world offers. Indeed, it is very much available in the social order of the church at large.  But the true calling of the believer is to deny all desire for glory coming from man.  For when the glory of Christ will appear, all other glory will bring us shame.  This does not mean we should never be praised or honored. It means our heart should never seek it or need it.</p>\n<p>On the other hand there is a glory which we have in Jesus (John17).  It is not visible or discernible by human senses. You might say it is veiled to the eyes of the world.  This glory comes and increases as we apply ourselves to releasing the government of God.  The more a man chooses to \'lay down his life\' the more of Christ\'s glory he shares.  The difference between the two \'glories\' is tremendous but especially notable in two ways.  First, one glory is darkness while the other is light.  This is wonderful but sometimes hard to appreciate while we live in the world.  The other is not so.  For while men are selling their souls by the brief applause of an envious crowd, the Glory of God will last forever.  Unlike, being the captain of the college football team, Christ has offered us an enduring and permanent glory.  The Apostle\'s understood the worthless and temporal nature of this world\'s glory writing the following.</p>\n<p>\'For I consider that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us.\'(Romans 8:18)</p>\n<p>\'All flesh is as grass, and all the glory of man as the flower of the grass.  The grass withers, and its flower falls away, but the word of the Lord endures forever.\'(1 Peter 1:24-25) </p>\n<p>The life of man is like a puff of smoke.  Here today and gone tomorrow.  Against the landscape of eternity it is less than a drop of water compared to all the oceans of the world.  When the glory of the coming Kingdom of Christ is revealed mankind will lament their wasted existence.  The believer will have his tears wiped away by the comfort of God.  Those tears however will not be tears of hurt or rejection, but tears of sorrow and mourning.  In that moment we will know Jesus was worthy of far more than what we gave.  Lord give us today a glimpse of your great glory and remove from our hearts any longing for the cheap imitations this world offers us!  Give us eyes to see clearly the wondrous inheritance prepared for us that we live before you in true humility and obedience.</p>'),(45,'Lines in the Sand','<p />When Columbus sailed to present day North America there were some who believed the world was flat.  The prevalent fear was that at some point they would drop off the end of the earth.  The level of fear each man possessed would most certainly be different.  For some, the vision of another land was a vague,\n\nuntrustworthy idea.  Had each man had the opportunity to turn back, the question is \'at what point would that have occurred?\'  Had they been on a train instead of a ship, you can be sure many sailors would have gone ?awol? in the night.  The point of departure comes as each one reaches the limits of their faith.  Once we reach the capacity of what is believed possible, the urge to exit begins to grow.  This is very much the case for every great and perilous adventure.  It most certainly applies to the Hebrew?s exit from Egypt in pursuit of the famed ?promise land?.</p>\n<p>While they left as one man there were many hearts and various expectations.  The scripture records that a mixed multitude went out.  This is an appropriate description of the vast diversity among them.  Though each had heard what Moses promised, not all believed.  The signs of power shown to Moses drew their attention but few were fully convinced.  The promise was like a very distant line being drawn in the sand.  Though the line was delineated by the promise, not all could see the line, neither could every heart extend that far.  Generations of crushed hope had left them with a hollow tradition of faith.  While they spoke of freedom and liberty, in the depths of their hearts, they had resigned themselves to perpetual slavery. Yet when it came time to leave, all left Egypt in the pretense of holding the same vision. </p>\n<p>They really should have counted the cost before departing, but one does not plan for what he does not intend.  And so hidden from the eyes of man, in the secret places of the heart, something was missing.  It is in this place where there is no faith, that the vision cannot take root.  The doubts will go unstated but they live hidden from all scrutiny.  Like most of us today, Moses? contemporaries were ignorant of their own faithlessness.  Unbelief only comes to light when we have journeyed to the limits of our capacity to believe.  Until then we talk as though we are journeying to the end, but somewhere the lines are drawn and the limits are predefined. </p>\n<p>Of course these limits remain a non-factor until the journey brings us to them.  Only then will they come into play.  It is only when we approach them that our discomfort begins.  Suddenly a sense of anxiety and a desire for safety overtakes us.  We may not even have the capacity to articulate the problem because we are ignorant of our heart?s condition.  These are issues of the heart and not the mind.  Nevertheless, we suddenly feel uneasy, unstable and unsafe.  For all the rhetoric of ?going all the way?, the truth is we never really knew the journey would take us this far.</p>\n<p>It is at this point where we become a liability to the corporate vision.  We invisibly shift from being on board to dragging our feet.  Even though the problem is clearly our lack of faith, we conveniently point to pseudo-problems in order to justify our misgivings.  Now comes the murmuring and complaining, which are the unmistakable qualities of unbelief (Hebrews 3:7-19).  When we stop believing we begin looking for tangible reasons to bail out.  The reality is small problems now become the outlet of choice for the growing tension over having gone further than we believed possible, or simply further than we understood. </p>\n<h4>The Lines</h4>\n<p>The real problem is with the lines that are drawn in our heart.  The lines are the limits of our faith ? the most we can possibly foresee or hope for.  The lines begin to be drawn the moment we first hear the promise.  For the Hebrews it began when a man called Moses appeared on the scene articulating a grand vision.  ?God spoke to me and promised a land flowing with milk and honey?, he says.  For most it is too good to be true.  After 400 years of slavery the thought of true liberty had long died.  Sure, a tradition of hope existed, but it was the talk of old men and dreams of the uninitiated youth.  Yet, the passion and conviction of this leader was too much to dismiss.  And throughout the nation people began to entertain a ray of hope.  Nevertheless outside of a few notable exceptions, the people were quite prepared to settle for less.  They did not actually believe in the final destination but perhaps there was something else for them.</p>\n<p>For some the promise meant simply a life without toil.  The thought of a house and a small piece of land without the threat of oppression was the most that could be hoped for.  Others may have believed for a strip of land on the side of the desert? a place where their children might somehow realize a normal existence.  Still others could see a little further and envisioned a city with it?s own government.  Maybe, just maybe a tiny bit of self-determination.  All of which fell far short of the spirit of prophecy circulating over the nation.  It is not that these things would have been wrong or not part of what the Lord was wishing to give.  The problem was that these limitations came from not being able to hear the Word of the Lord.<br />?And to whom did He swear that they would not enter His rest, but to those who did not obey?  So we see that they could not enter in because of unbelief.? (Hebrews 3:18-19)</p>\n<p>??but the word did not profit them, not being mixed with faith in those who heard it.? (Hebrews 4:2b)<br />Dreams had previously been crushed and they were unable to heed Moses word because of cruel bondage and anguish of spirit (Exodus 6:9).  ?Hope deferred makes the heart sick? and for many the idealism of youth had long ago melted away.  The scar left on the heart impeded them from seeing that this was far more than idealism.  It was the sound of inevitability looking for a heart in which to rest. For many the heart had already ventured to believe once too often, only to be disappointed again and again.  So now when the promise of a land flowing with milk and honey comes, it is too much to fathom.</p>\n<p>The result is that in the shadow of this larger vision, a lesser vision is nurtured.  We exchange a wonderful plan for something far less.  ?I cannot believe for a land flowing with milk and honey, but I believe we can find a place just beyond the reach of Pharaoh?.  Our willingness to settle for less remains hidden for a time.  It is only when we approach or cross the threshold of our expectations that the tension becomes apparent.  At that moment faith gives way to fear.</p>\n<h4>Fear</h4>\n<p>When a man goes beyond what he believes possible fear rises.  Faith enabled him to behold what he could not see with his natural eyes.  But now, without faith there is no sight and no understanding.  Faith provided the substance (dry land) when substance was unavailable.  Now without something to hold onto my flesh requires a replacement.  Like a fearful sailor the urge to return to dry land consumes me. This is exactly what happened to the nation of Israel.  ?Why does this Moses want to destroy what we have? Were there not enough graves in Egypt that he had to bring us to this desert to kill us??  Their fear caused them to continually prophesy their demise.  The fact that they now possessed a freedom they did want to lose meant they were tormented all the more.</p>\n<p>The problem is that the challenge of believing for greater things seems to put in jeopardy the hope of lesser things.  For those who never believed they would leave Egypt alive, it was time to cut their losses.  ?Why risk the first chance at a normal life for what I do not believe possible.  Why should we go to battle against other nations and risk having our children become slaves once again?\'  ?I do not believe ? I cannot go further.? For those that are satisfied with a plot of land and a house just beyond the reach of Pharaoh every step beyond them is a death they cannot bear.  They neither want more nor are they prepared to sacrifice further to go farther.</p>\n<p>As such they are truly a mixed multitude ? one people with multiple visions.  Someone once said this is the recipe for division.  Without a common vision the people are easily fragmented as spirits of fear prey on their unbelief.  Now that they had achieved what most believed improbable, it seemed unwise to risk it for what seemed truly impossible?  It is out of this fear that rebellion was born.  The people would not believe and so chose something less than the promise and defied those who would have them face their fears.  <br />Had this been primarily about God delivering them from the hand of Pharaoh this would not have been a problem.  But God was not so limited and His ultimate intention was far greater.  As a nation they were a beginning point for the work of God in the earth ? a kingdom of priests that would become the expression of His heart to the nations.</p>\n<p>?Now therefore, if you will indeed obey My voice and keep my covenant, then you shall be a special treasure to Me above all people; for all the earth is mine.  And you shall be a kingdom of priests and a holy nation.? (Exodus 19:5-6)</p>\n<p>As His own special people they would be the scepter of redemption for the nations.  His intention was not to merely occupy a small strip of land east of the Mediterranean Sea.   Rather, He anticipated doing what He had always intended ? to fill the earth with the knowledge of the glory of the Lord.  This is the ultimate line in the sand.  The anger of the Lord?s displeasure was in the fact that Israel constantly interpreted the promises of God in the light of their own need for security and comfort.  Their refusal to enter the promised land almost resulted in them being annihilated.  The truth is they feared losing their children to captivity.  In His judgment the Lord declared that these very children would walk in faith and possess it.  Of that present generation all would perish save Joshua and Caleb.  The Lord declared them to be of a ?different spirit?, and that Caleb ?fully followed the Lord?.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, the unbelief of the rest of the nation meant they were putting the intention of the Lord in jeopardy.  Since that time the Lord has only looked for, and been pleased by one thing: Faith.  The Lord is pleased by those who believe His Word.  This Caleb did!  Thus the Lord is only asking for us to do one thing ? to not lean on our own understanding and to be willing to let Him draw the line.</p>\n<h4>The Pattern</h4>\n<p>The consequences of this truth are many.  Today in churches and lives throughout Christendom this pattern is repeated again and again.  While the Lord says ?all the earth is mine? few believers actually believe it.  Though the Spirit has drawn a line in the sand that encompasses the nations, Christians are content to draw their own lines.  According to our limited gifts and abilities we imagine what we might do and where we might go, and there we draw our line.  We are quickly satisfied by the achievements that distinguish us in the eyes of others and abandon the greater hope.</p>\n<p>For some, the lines are drawn in terms of professional advancement or material acquisitions.  Others cannot see past being a father, wife or husband.  Pastors and spiritual leaders, while still in the midst of training and development, set the boundaries of their hope by the ministry they visualize.  For many the apex of success is to become the senior pastor of any congregation.  When that ambition is realized they spend the remainder of their days guarding their achievement.   In the church new believers are discipled into corners by the lines drawn by those they respect.  Theology and ministry becomes defined by what is known and what is safe.  We are taught that the highest order of Christian life is to be a tithing regular church attendee.  ?If you are faithful enough you might one day get on the board?.  All of these become demarcation points for our zeal and limitations to our faith.</p>\n<p>In the midst of this great company of people exist others still who once envisioned the impossible and ventured.  Prayer warriors heard the cry, believed and advanced.  Great things happened and the fulfillment of still greater things appeared on the horizon.  But in the midst of promise came the disappointment.  Leaders fell, friends were wounded, churches were divided and movements became still stagnant waters.  In the wake of disappointment we settle for something less, inoculated against a greater vision.  Not unlike those Hebrews who once believed and lost hope. </p>\n<p>??but they could not heed Moses, because of anguish of spirit and cruel bondage.\' (Exodus 6:9)<br />Even so the Spirit of the Lord calls to those who once believed to awaken to a fresh hope.  The challenge of the Lord is to lift up our eyes to Him who calls those things which are not as though they are.  He is calling us to repentance over the lines we have drawn in the sand, and urging us to look to the greater promise.  As He said to Moses when they would not enter the land, ?I have pardoned according to your word; But truly, as I live, all the earth shall be filled with the glory of the Lord.? (Numbers 14:20-21)  This is the one line to which all others must yield.  For in as much as every knee shall bow, ultimately, every line will yield.</p>'),(46,'Entering the Deep','<p />There is a call presently going out to the Church.  It says, \'make ready the way of the Lord\'.  It is not so much a mandate to prepare things for Him, as it is a calling to make\nourselves ready to enter the way of the Lord.  His \'way\' will be the key to being victorious in the coming battles, which will be increasing hazardous.  What we are going to experience can be likened to the reality every soldier faces when moving from training to full scale combat.  Thus, the Lord is asking the Church this question.  \'If you have run with the footmen, and they have wearied you, then how can you contend with the horses?\'  The key to overcoming in the coming days is found in embracing the current training.  If we treasure our lessons by embracing His way, we will find ourselves not only surviving but flourishing.</p>\n<h4>The Key of Athletics</h4>\n<p>While growing up I spent a great deal of time in sports.  I was not always the best but I was drawn to the thrill of competition.  One of my favorite sports was soccer.  Like most athletic activities, perfecting basic technics and skills is key to competing at the higher levels.  In soccer this began with learning the proper mechanics of kicking the ball.</p>\n<p>The cardinal rule was \'never strike the ball with your toe\'.  We were repeatedly told to use the laces portion of the foot.  I tried kicking with the laces but found I could kick much harder and further with my toe.  Being somewhat short in both wisdom and long term vision, I chose to do things my way. The fact that I was more concerned with doing well in the next game than I was with the next season, was my major problem.  Eventually the error of my wisdom began to materialize.  By the time I was 13 the skill of my counterparts were steadily improving while my own capacity to kick the ball harder and further had stagnated.  Furthermore, my accuracy was even more deficient leaving me at a greater disadvantage.  To my benefit I took serious measures to correct my deficiency, but not before learning a valuable lesson.  The lesson can be summarized in the following: Short term success is not worth the cost of long term failure.</p>\n<p>This lesson holds true in many environments.  While in the beginning our own way seems preferable, and for a time at least as beneficial, we will inevitably find ourselves in a realm where we are unable to compete.  This scenario illustrates the current state of the Church.  We have functioned in a realm where people with gifted minds and personalities could do remarkably well. This is about to change!  The Church is entering a dimension of warfare and spiritual activity which necessitates an explicit reliance on the leading of the Spirit. Nothing else will suffice!  To this end the Holy Spirit has been calling us into a place of deep abiding faith; a place where human wisdom and intelligence takes a distant second place to being led by the sound of His voice alone.  \'Today if you will hear His voice...\'(Hebrews 4:7)</p>\n<p>While many leaders and laymen have heeded the call, many others have chosen to live by a natural wisdom.  Though in this environment they may have done well, we are entering a time when nothing but a true dependence on Him will prevail.  Those who have shunned these days of training will find themselves ill prepared for the coming challenges of the Christian faith.  The shortfall may not appear immediately, but will become increasingly evident by an inability to keep pace with what the Spirit is doing and saying.</p>\n<h4>On the Water</h4>\n<p>Another scenario which depicts our current status is that of a typical lake.  We have been like boaters content to navigate shallow and safe waters.  Since we could always retreat to the safety of land there was no need to learn how to navigate using instruments.  In this environment you always know where you are and where you need to go.  Everything is in plain view.  If the waters become choppy you head to the safety of your familiar moorings.  But what happens if suddenly these moorings were no longer accessible?  And what if the lake becomes an ocean, a virtual spiritual waterworld? This is somewhat the picture of what is going to happen.  The knowledge of the glory of the Lord is going to cover the earth as the waters cover the sea.  Then, only those who have learned to navigate by the mind of the spirit will be free to move with God.</p>\n<p>The moorings we have trusted are our theological understanding and experience in the Church.  We have been content to judge what is God and what is not God by our current level of experience.  We think \'if it has not happened in our Church, it probably is not God.\'</p>\n<p>No matter how broad our experience, there can be no accurate discernment through these means. Why else would the Lord give us the Proverb, \'lean not on your own understanding\'.?  Besides, how dare we justify evaluating the works of a God by our limited knowledge, when His ways are not our ways and His thoughts are not our thoughts(Isaiah 55:8-9).  When we trust our own understanding we make it impossible for God to be God in our lives.  As soon as the Lord exercises His divine prerogative to be unique we can no longer walk with Him.</p>\n<p>If there is one lesson to be learned from the volumes of scriptures it is the willingness of God to confound the wisdom of man.  Furthermore, He does this by doing things He has not previously done. In other words the Lord enjoys being unprecedented.  If the measure of what is and is not God is based on our history or the history of others, we will surely miss Him.  Wasn\'t this the error of the Pharisees?  Although they were entirely conversant with all God had done, and though they diligently searched the scriptures, they were unable to recognize the Son of God when He came(John 5:40).  Their determination was based on their present experience and knowledge. \'Surely God would not operate outside of the boundaries we have come to understand Him in?\', they thought.  After all, \'we are the elect of God\'.  This kind of presumption would be funny if there were not so much at stake.</p>\n<p>It is time for us to leave the safety of our limited understanding.  If we want to continue walking with the Lord we must lay hold of His ways.  Moses knew the Lord\'s ways and was therefore not limited by the range of acts he had come to witness.  Likewise, neither will we be limited when we know His ways.  This means more than knowing that He is good and kind, and that He likes to heal. It means knowing the sound of His voice when He speaks.  When that is the case, our only limitation is the breadth of His knowledge and experience, which is considerable.</p>\n<p>It\'s like the old proverb which says \'Give a man a fish and you feed him for a day, teach him to fish and you have fed him for life\'.  The man who \'lives by every word which proceeds from His mouth\', will never be at a loss.; no matter where the Lord goes or what He does. </p>\n<p>In this case He is about to do a great deal.  He is launching out to the deep and desires us to follow. He is taking the Church to a place where there is no land or beach or lighthouse to direct us.  We must know how to navigate, in the words of this nautical analogy, by the stars. In short, we must know how to be led by the spirit of God.  Afterall, who can deny the most significant criteria for being a son of God.</p>\n<p>\'For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, these are sons of God.\'(Romans 8:14)</p>\n<p>Who are sons of God? It is those who know Him and who hear His voice.  Though we may be happy to count ourselves in because we go to Church and carry Bibles, the true criteria is being led by the Spirit of God.  This becomes the line of demarcation between those who will survive this transition and those who will not.  The one who has made personality and intellectual strength his confidence will not make the grade.  In the words of Hebrews, \'let us fear lest any of you seem to have come short of it.\' (Hebrews 4:1)</p>\n<h4>A True Faith </h4>\n<p>Our problem is we have been trained to believe only what we understand.  And what we understand is limited to what is known through the five senses.  The advent of the industrial revolution and modern science has strengthened the need for imperial evidence.  We believe what we can see and touch.  While this may seem trustworthy, what can be seen and touched is a small fraction of what exists.  Even the discoveries of science in the last 200 years tell us as much.  Imagine the frustration of the medical doctor who first discovered germs. T rying to convert the thinking of the arrogant medical community was an astounding task.  \'You mean to make us believe in this day and age, that invisible microbes are responsible to passing infections from one person to another? Preposterous!\'</p>\n<p>They would not believe what they could not see.  Bringing them past their current experience was almost impossible. Why?  Because the mind was never meant to be the vehicle for discovering truth, be it imperial, spiritual or otherwise.  The mind is a very limited neuro processor. It is subject to programming much like a computer.  On the other hand, the Lord has given man a spirit by which he can know God. It is the mind submitted to the Spirit which can appreciate the unseen.  Only a man\'s spirit is equipped to grasp the vast expanse of God\'s unlimited creativity and knowledge.  Truth is a spiritual reality which must be grasped by one\'s spirit before it becomes understood by the mind. Seeing the invisible is the function of faith, something for which the mind is not well adapted.</p>\n<p>Again, let us make clear what we are speaking about.  Basic truth, which is logical, proven, and demonstrated can be grasped by the minds of men.  Many have accepted the orthodoxy of Christianity on this basis.  When examined, the Christian faith is clearly a sensible and credible way of life.  This the mind can accept!  However this is only the very thin outer covering of the Christian faith.  The true nature of the Christian faith is mystical and spiritual.</p>\n<p>\'But the natural man does not receive the things of the Spirit of God, for they are foolishness to him; nor can he know them, because they are spiritually discerned.\' (1 Corinthians 2:13) </p>\n<p>Consider the Lord\'s encounter with Nicodemus, an intelligent leader of the Jewish people.  He has enough of a leaning toward Jesus to meet Him, howbeit, at night.  Then without so much as a cordial greeting Jesus blurts out \'Most assuredly, I say to you, unless one is born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God\' (John 3:3).  He does not qualify anything with explanation but continues teaching in a way which Nicodemus does not understand.  Jesus makes no effort to appeal to Nicodemus\' current wisdom or experience.  This progresses through verse eight when He says, \'The wind blows where it wishes, and you hear the sound of it, but cannot tell where it comes from and where it goes.  So is everyone who is born of the Spirit.\' <br />The very nature of being a believer requires us to be moved and led by the Spirit.  This requires faith more than anything.  The Christian is not called to understand, he is called to believe.  The entire ministry of Jesus is built on this foundation.  When we seek to understand before we determine to believe ours will be an intellectual faith.  Rather, the Lord looked for those who believed. When He found them, He gave them understanding.  Even then, He used remarkable means which continually tested them.  The test included only one continuous question.  Will you follow in the ways of the Spirit, or will you fall back to what you can understand?</p>\n<p>Because they chose to believe Him, the twelve disciples became the most vivid example of true faith.  Some may think it would have been quite wonderful to live with Jesus.  However, operating beyond the limits of your own understanding can be incredibly stressful.  One can perhaps put up with it for a few days but three years is quite another thing.  Consider how often the disciples did not understand what He was saying.  From His death on the cross, to the many parables, to the teaching on eating His flesh and blood, they continued to follow without understanding. (Mark 9:32, Luke 2:50, Luke 18:34, John 10:6, John 14:9)  Granted they were obtaining a gradual revelation but their life with Him was largely a mystery.  It was not until after Jesus returned to the Father did the fuller picture dawn on them.</p>\n<p>His disciples did not understand these things at the first: but when Jesus was glorified, then they remembered that these things were written about him, and that they had done these things to him.(John 12:16 )</p>\n<p>If we are to follow in the footsteps of Christ we must learn to live by faith.  This does not mean we will never understand. It does mean putting the \'need to understand\' to death.  When it has died revelation will rise in its place.  Then what we have will not be mere knowledge, it will be a living understanding.  This understanding, or revelation as we like to call it, will form the essensial building blocks of the Kingdom of God (Matthew 16:18).  Building blocks we cannot acquire without choosing to leave the realm of human strength and ability.</p>\n<h4>The River</h4>\n<p>When Ezekiel saw the river of God, it came out of the Eastern gate as little more than a trickle.  As it flowed further the volume of water increased in breadth and depth.  Progressing from ankle, knee, to waste deep and so on, the water finally eclipsed the stature of a man.  To remain in the river beyond this point meant one had to swim.  This is where we are going.  The question we must answer is this:  Will we swim or must we be in control of where we are going by having our feet on the ground?  The river will soon be too deep to stand in.  My heart and prayer is that each of us will choose to stay in the river and go wherever He leads us.</p>'),(47,'Fruit Which Remains','<p />It should be the desire of every Christian to not only bear fruit, but bear fruit that remains.  Jesus said, You have not chosen me, but I have chosen you, and ordained you, that ye should go and bear fruit, and that your fruit should remain:... (John 15:16).  Fruit which remains must be understood to be eternal and spiritual in nature.  Hence we can call it eternal fruit.  Unfortunately our immaturity has\n\nled us to measure fruit in ways which have nothing to do with the criteria Jesus established.  Consequently, we end up pursuing what is natural instead of what is spiritual, and thereby producing what is temporal instead of what is eternal.  It is fruit of a sort, but not fruit which remains.  If we wish to be fruitful in the manner of Jesus, knowing the difference between plain fruit and eternal fruit is essential.</p>\n<h4>Spiritual and Natural</h4>\n<p>I recently spent time in a part of our country known for it?s abundant fruit.  At the peak of harvest there is so much fruit available one can hardly give it away.  Since apples, peaches and pears all mature at relatively the same season, the region is inundated with abundance.  Unfortunately, the window for eating it is very small and there is too much to consume before it quickly begins to spoil.  It was for this reason Jesus used the analogy of fruit which remains.  The very nature of fruit suggests a short life cycle; fruit which will not remain.  Jesus evidently thought being fruitful was insufficient.  Producing fruit which would not spoil was the real goal.  This presents us with a peculiar challenge.  For while some will produce eternal fruit, many more will bring to life that which will quickly spoil.  How then does one ensure the right results?</p>\n<p>The problem begins as soon as a person applies himself to becoming fruitful.  Since we are initially unable to appreciate the difference between eternal and temporal fruit, we approach it as the naturally minded and not the spiritually minded.  Being ignorant of His ways, which are higher than ours, we face a profound problem.  Consequently, before the first task of ministry has even begun, failure is an inevitable conclusion. <br />Take for example the desire to bear eternal fruit.  When approached as a goal, dividing it into achievable steps seems logical.  The first part would consist of bearing fruit.  The second would be a reckless and desperate attempts to make sure it remained.  If one were a Pastor whose vision was to have a good size congregation, being fruitful might be interpreted as getting 500 people involved in the church.  The next step would mean doing whatever it took to keep them.  Then, if one managed to maintain that number, he or she would believe themselves to have established eternal fruit.  But how does this approach line up to the pattern of Jesus own ministry? </p>\n<h4>The Jesus Method </h4>\n<p>First it would be accurate to describe His vision as large, . . .  He expected to receive the nations as His inheritance.  In the beginning things start strong as in a short period of time He rises to prominence, demonstrating miracles while amazing the masses with His authoritative preaching.  Then at what seemed the height of His popularity He introduces the doctrine of eating His flesh and blood  which of course was not a doctrine but a test.  When the people became offended and began leaving, His disciples came to Him hoping for an explanation.  Instead of a clarification He invites them to depart as well.  This  is done despite knowing they had misunderstood His actual meaning.  It almost seems as though Jesus was entirely unconcerned about fruit as we know it.  Not only was it vanishing, it seems like a deliberate attempt to ensure there would not be any at all.</p>\n<p>Clearly this is not the case.  However, it highlights for us a pattern which is not according to the course of this world.  It is neither led, guided or measured against any conventional wisdom.  In fact one could argue that Jesus pattern included a distinct lack of any predictable pattern.  The closest explanation we get is a picture of the wind.   He said, ÒThat which is born of the flesh is flesh, and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit.  The wind blows where it wishes, and you hear the sound of it, but cannot tell where it comes from and where it goes.  So is everyone who is born of the Spirit.(John 2:6 & 8)  Like the wind, the life of Jesus was void of predictable actions.  Furthermore, He appeared to violate every course of wisdom which would otherwise ensure the fulfillment of His vision.  To this day, those who have no eyes to see deride Him as an utter failure.  And if we were to measure Him as we do with ourselves and each other, we would perhaps do the same.</p>\n<p>Consider this overview of His ministry: He began in obscurity, developed a ministry following to the point where multiple thousands were being reached, but finished with 11 scruffy survivors.  If we were to measure the fruit of His ministry upon His death, how would we be inclined to evaluate His success?  Not well I am sure!  Why is this?  Because we use the wrong methods for measuring  methods which are preoccupied with questions of visible numbers and size.  They are natural and therefore irrelevant to the Kingdom of God.  In fact, they not only disqualify us from joining Christ in His labor, they open the door to criticism and rejection of those who do. </p>\n<h4>The Call to Die </h4>\n<p>Questions of size and numbers cannot quantify the presence of eternal fruit because the true fruit of the Lords ministry is spiritual.  As such it begins as a seed; small and often unrecognizable.  Which is a problem when a part of our heart longs to make the big splash and demonstrate our value to others.  But herein is a death we must choose if we would be partakers of the heavenly kingdom.  We must resist the tyranny of mens opinions and the conventional wisdom of our own hearts, to do what is deplorable and insignificant in the sight of men.  Or in the words of the often quoted prophetic proverb, despise not small beginnings.  Was this not Jesus encrypted meaning when He spoke of the mustard seed?</p>\n<p>The Kingdom of heaven is like a mustard seed, which a man took and sowed in his field, which indeed is the least of all the seeds; but when it is grown it is greater than the herbs and becomes a tree, so that the birds of the air come and nest in its branches. (Matthew 13:31-32)</p>\n<p>The mustard seed is the least of all seeds.  It is neither glorious or imposing in size.  Compared to other seeds it pales in perceived worth, if taken at present face value.  However, upon reaching maturity  when it is grown  it exceeds every other herbs in that it is not only larger, but distinguished by being a tree as opposed to a mere plant.  Likewise, when we choose the seed which is spiritual over that which is natural, there is a requirement of humble beginnings, but a promised harvest of unfathomable greatness and grandeur.  We may choose to plant and nurture something which comes to maturity much quicker, but in so doing we exchange the eternal for the temporary. </p>\n<p>The challenge we face from our world, including other believers and the pride of our own carnal hearts, is doing things as the Lord would have us rather than playing to the expectations of onlookers.  It is the difference between pleasing men (and that part of us which loves their praises), or laying our lives down for the sake of the Kingdom of God.  It means dying to the wisdom of a carnal mind, superficially given to serving a higher purpose, but secretly seduced by a lust for self-promotion and fading glory.  All of which Jesus forsook in both the manner in which He lived and means by which He died.  He was the perfect representation of that spiritual man, referenced by the Apostle Paul, who is rightly judged by no one. <br />But the natural man does not receive the things of the Spirit of God, for they are foolishness to him; nor can he know them, because they are spiritually discerned.  But he who is spiritual judges all things, yet he himself is rightly judged by no one. (1 Corinthians 2:14-15)</p>\n<p>The man given to natural wisdom cannot comprehend the way of the spirit, no better than the darkness can comprehend the light (John 1:5).  He does not see as God sees and therefore cannot embrace what is honorable to God.  The calling of faith is to see what the natural eye cannot, beholding the culture of another kingdom whose ways are foreign to this realm.  When we possess such vision we cannot labor as does the natural man, knowing it will produce nothing but stubble to be displaced and burned.  <br />Like all men of true vision we are called to see further into the distance.  Doing so will open up the universe of a God whose ways are unattainable.  In turn, causing us to follow a peculiar line of direction, which evades the limited reach of a carnal mind.  A line which will often bring us into direct conflict with the success principles of this present age.  Thankfully, we do not lose hope whatever failures we or others around us may make.  Knowing His people will be volunteers in the day of His power (Psalm 110:1)</p>\n<p>Jesus believed there would be a generation who would produce fruit which remained.  A people fully given to the hidden wisdom exorcised in faithful obedience.  Of whom, are hundreds if not thousands, who presently wait as faithful servants deserving this rare distinction.  Who have forsaken the much traveled path to quick and easy success.  Some are in places of prominence, many or most are not. Those who are not, labor faithfully in quiet hidden places away from the gaze of glory seekers.  Like the patient farmer they wait for the fruit of the earth, knowing he that sows to the flesh will from the flesh reap corruption; but he that sows to the spirit shall from the spirit reap everlasting life (Galatians 6:8).</p>'),(48,'Glory in Earthen Vessels','<p>One of the greatest Biblical mysteries concerns the glory of God and the weakness of the human vessel.  One can hardly imagine two things so distinctly different.  The glory of God represents all that makes God supreme and all-powerful.  Comparatively, the lowly frame of man is vulnerable, weak and incredibly temporary.  What an extraordinary thing for God Almighty to put His His Spirit and Glory within man.  It is a mystery which defies human reasoning--a secret of the wisdom of God.  Although our natural inclination is to dismiss or redefine this mystery, the heart of God is for us to see His magnificent wisdom at work in it.</p>\n\n<h4>The Greatness of God</h4>\n<p>When we speak of the glory of God we speak of His strength, power and brilliance.  From the creation of the world to the destruction of Egypt and beyond, the Scriptures declare the wonder of a God far beyond the dismal abilities of man.  The idea that even a portion of Him could be deposited in man is not logical.  It would be like storing burning coals in a Styrofoam cup.  Realistically speaking, the human vessel is not naturally equipped to contain such energy.</p>\n<p>When Moses asked for the privilege of seeing this power the Lord responded, \'You cannot see My face; for no man shall see Me, and live.\' (Exodus. 33:20)  The very view of God in all His glory is enough to consume man.  To make it barely possible Moses was put in the cleft of the rock, while God covered him with His hand.  While Moses only saw the train of His garment, his face glowed white with God\'s glory. </p>\n<p>In short man and God\'s glory do not mix.  Nevertheless, the Lord thrives on confounding the wisdom men.  Therefore He chose to put His glory within man (Colossians 1:27).</p>\n<h4>A Higher Wisdom</h4>\n<p>God seems to enjoy doing what is unlikely, impossible and even foolish to men.  In this case He has concealed what is perfect inside of the imperfect in order to frustrate those who consider themselves wise.  Whereas we would always store something of splendor inside something equal in beauty, the Lord does not.  This is a contradiction of sorts -- a paradox.  It means in order for man to believe the wisdom of God he must lay down his own.  An essential principle in the Kingdom of God -- one which many Christians often lose sight. <br />As the Scriptures declare, \'As the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my ways higher than your ways, and my thoughts than your thoughts (Isaiah 55:9)\'.  By design the Lord works in ways which men think will He never would.  One good reason for holding to this proverb: \'Trust in the Lord with all of your heart and lean not to our own understanding\'. (Proverbs 3:5)</p>\n<p>No doubt this truth the Pharisees missed.  Their approach to God told them they should understand all God was doing.  When Jesus came they were not able to receive Him.  He was not what they expected.  They listened but were unable to decipher what He was saying.  Refusing to lay down their wisdom in favor of faith, they stumbled over God\'s wisdom.  Likewise do we when we fail to lay down our wisdom to lay hold of His.  This is essentially what happens in the matter of the human vessel and the glory of God.</p>\n<h4>The Paradox</h4>\n<p>The more we see of the Lord\'s glory, the harder it is to deal with the incompatibility.  It begins once we come to understand the promise of God.  All of a sudden our sense of status in heavenly things is elevated.  We feel privileged and empowered at the thought of God\'s very essence being poured into us.  We savor the truth of having been\'sat down together in heavenly places with Christ Jesus\' (Ephesians 2:6).  Each encounter with God gives us a sense of His perfection which we desperately want to emulate.  Yet, surfacing from time to time is a nagging irritation -- our natural man.  While we are motivated onward and upward toward the beauty and perfection of God we seem strangely anchored to this earth.  The anchor is none other than the typical weakness of the earthen vessel.</p>\n<p>At this point our enemy would convince us to hold our weakness in contempt Yet, the Lord has determined to be glorified in the things which are not, to bring to nothing the things which are. To the natural mind glory and the earthen vessel are irreconcilable. They present an oxymoron, wherein it is impossible to be both weak and strong.</p>\n<p>Thus, the experience of God\'s power in our spirits gives the sense we can completely erase our humanity. Suddenly the possibility of being \'super Christian\' comes to life. In that moment of grace we bid goodbye to all our human weakness, only to find it surface again. Instead of entirely removing our weakness, we are left to live in the tension between the glory and the earthen vessel.</p>\n<p>This is not to say we are meant to live an existence of failure. There is a realm of victory beyond what most of us know to be possible. And indeed that is where the Lord is taking us. However it is not apprehended by denying the earthen vessel. It will come as a work of grace through faith. Believing in spite of our natural condition. It is a faith which allows the weak to declare, \'I am Strong!\'. It is not blind to human weakness; just confident in the power of God. The desire to do away with the earthen vessel is an expression of unbelief and impatience not faith--the carnal man\'s shortcut to perfection.</p>\n<h4>False Glory</h4>\n<p>Far from being a detriment to our progress, our humanity forms a strategic part in God\'s plan. It is a litmus test of true faith. For while we have a sincere desire to be like Christ, there lurks in our heart an ambition for perfection as defined by man. Ironically, it is this same ambition which fuels humanism and the new age search for the perfect \'godman\'. For the purpose of this writing we can call this ambition \'false glory\'. \'False\' because it is not a desire to glorify God but a desire to glorify one\'s own self in the name of God. We can know it by the characteristics which define it.</p>\n<p>Among them is its affinity for carnal wisdom. Since it cannot comprehend the mystery of God, it stumbles over the paradoxes of scripture. It can accept only one side of the mystery at a time. When the opposite ends of a paradox are being discussed it can acknowledge both but it cannot believe both. This makes practical applications in the wisdom of God a confusing matter. Those caught up in this confusion are often frustrated by their inability to find a balance between two things which appear to be equally valid. In the end they will choose to emphasize one side to the neglect of the other.</p>\n<p>Secondly, \'false glory\' cannot see God. Blessed are the pure in heart for they shall see God (Matthew 5:8). Purity has to do with singleness of heart. When there is \'false glory\' there is duplicity. So while one can long to be godly, there is only a form of godliness and not the true nature of God. In reality it is reaching for godlike perfection without the power of God.</p>\n<p>This is very much the issue of original sin. Adam and Eve thought to become like God by the tree of knowledge instead of through the knowledge of God. Rather than living by the revelation of God they are left with their deductive reasoning. Now unable to live out of a lifegiving knowledge of God they must deduce what He must be like, while trying to be the same. They become overly preoccupied with doing the right thing at the right time. Everything is calculated and planned; it is all rather mechanical and not very real. <br />The third dynamic is an outcome the inabitity to see God. Since God is love, there is no revelation of love, whereas\'the goal of our instruction is love...\'. Since being good is important to an ideal of perfection, there might be strong emotional sensitivity and many attempts to bless others. However, there is no real love. <br />Then when perfection is not realized the true character of their ambition rises. Here is where we see the clearest distinction between the true desire to glorify God from \'false glory\'. False glory despises the imperfection of the earthen vessel. This manifests in a loathing of weakness both in oneself and in others. When our heart is filled with \'false glory\' we have great difficulty forgiving ourselves or others. When we appear weak or our image of success is somehow compromised, there is a tremendous sense of shame and failure.</p>\n<h4>Conclusion</h4>\n<p>Though we might see some of these characteristics in ourselves this should not condemn us, but bring us to a place of humility. It is healthy to realize when \'false glory\' is to some degree at work in us, since the essence of the Christian Life is growth. We are going from a place where our live were consumed with \'false glory\', to the place where we live only to serve Him. While we would certainly love to be there immediately, such is not likely the case.</p>\n<p>More than that we have a predisposition to deception. Hence \'we shall know the truth in increasing increments, and be free in increasing increments\' (John 8:32 paraphrase). To not know the truth is deception defined.</p>\n<p>In the mean time we live faithfully to the degree we have attained. Each of us have a revelation of Him and certain clarity with which we are held responsible. The absence or the presence of \'false glory\' is so subtle it is not possible for us to deal with it. We can rest in the knowledge that the Lord is dealing with it. Our responsibility is to recognize the signals of its presence and humble ourselves. Choose to abandon our understanding and seek feverishly for a greater revelation of His in wisdom and power. This is only remedy for the problem of \'false glory\'.</p>'),(49,'Holyfield by David Demien and Marc Brisebois','<p>On Saturday, June 28th, 1997,  the second of two consecutive World Heavyweight bouts between Mike Tyson and current champion Evander Holyfield, took place.  Holyfield, a devout and fervent Christian, publicly praised</p>\n\n<p>God for the victory in the first fight.  Tyson, a convert to Islam, had on another occasion declared that \'Muhammed had knocked Jesus out of the ring\', after beating Holyfield.  This made Tyson\'s subsequent challenge to Holyfield a challenge against the supremacy of the Lord Jesus.  Their encounter illustrates a prophetic message for the future of the Church and the World.</p>\n<p>Often, in the case of high profile events, the Lord chooses to make a statement to the world.  The natural things will speak of spiritual things.  Concerning this one Vancouver sports headline read \'Jesus vs Muhammed\'.  Though it would be a mistake to think that every Christian competing in athletics respresents the Kingdom of God, this match had overtones of purpose from the very start.  To begin with the first bout was considered a mismatch.  Sports writers and Las Vegas gamblers sided with Tyson.  From a purely physical standpoint Holyfield did not demonstrate the skill or power to defeat Mike Tyson.  Yet, Holyfield shut Tyson down giving credit to Jesus.  Whether or not it was openly declared, these men represented more than their own personal skill, they each stood for their God.</p>\n<p>Leading up to the second fight sports analysts and reporters favored Tyson\'s corner.  However, Holyfield prepared himself not only physically but spiritually.  In his dressing room before the fight he prayed and praised.  Surrounded by Christian praise music, he made it his aim to enter the ring with the presence of God.  In addition, recent press conferences revealed he had received words from prophets concerning the outcome of the fight.  As Israel went to war with Judah-- meaning praise--at the front, Evander was surrounded in worship.  Even as his entourage exited the dressing rooms, Christian music ushered the boxer to the ring.  His secret weapon was not boxing strategy, a fresh jap, or widly powerful left hook--It was the presence of Almighty God.</p>\n<p>The nature of the presence of God will forces confrontations with demonic forces.  The manifestation in the ring that night was not Tyson, but the typical response of any demon being confronted by the invasive presence of Christ.  Driven into a frenzied fury and powerless to control themselves, they are sent into a blinding lunatic rage.  Such became the condition of Mike Tyson.  Then, without common sense, anticipation or decision he bites Holyfield.  Not once but twice!</p>\n<p>Afterwards he could not explain his actions.  No doubt he did not appreciate the nature of the situation he found himself in. In his public apology he reported: <br />\'I cannot tell you why, exactly, I acted like I did...\' <br />\'I have also reached out since Saturday to the medical professionals for help, to tell me why I did what I did and I will have that help.\'</p>\n<p>Neither he nor any Physician will find the true cause for his uncontrolled outburst without more spiritual understanding.  Of course Scripture is full of similar examples as what occured that night in the ring.  For instance, when King Saul, who was himself demonized, found himself amongst the prophets the Spirit of God fell on him.  He prophesied while at the same time stripping off his clothes and rolling on the ground. (1 Sam. 19:24)  When the Spirit of God came upon Saul, the demon within him went into a fit of rage, as though being tortured with fire.  Similar examples of raging devils can be found thoughout the New Testament.  This includes a legion of demons who, upon being cast of out of a man and sent into a herd of swine, provoked them into a wild rampage. Their response led them stampeding into the sea.</p>\n<p>This leads us to our present understanding.  When the Church truly begins to walk in the presence of God darkness will be revealed for what it is.  The enemy has succeeded in making evil appear attractive.  There is demonic glory covering the evil of this world which hides the reality of what it represents.  The presence of God will reveal the depravity of this wickedness.  In this fight Tyson represents all the strongholds of the demonic kingdom--from the deceptions of religious Judaism, to Islam fundamentalism and the mentality behind all the Asian religions.  The Lord\'s intent is not only to defeat the darkness, but show it as it truly is. <br />When the world begins to experience the presence of God in the Church it will see evil as it is.  The unsaved will pour into the Kingdom of God because evil will appear evil in their eyes.  The empty tyranny within false religious systems will become clear!  The depraved and destructive power of sexual immorality will be unveiled!  Corruption in political systems and the evil behind the betrayal of public trust will be openly understood!  And through it all, Jesus will be honored and glorified as He rightly deserves.  He will be lifted up, and as He said, \'all men will be drawn to Himself\'.</p>\n<p>We as the Church need to expect that God will not only defeat evil , but that as with Tyson, He will reveal it.  But it is not doctrinal systems, or elaborate Church growth programs which can do this--Only the presence of God.  The presence of God has an inherant ability to make clear.  When men stand to be judged before almighty God, it will be His presence which judges.  No explanations will be needed; no court will recess for discussion; no attorneys will present a defense.  When men come into the presence of God they become openly confronted with reality.  Gone will be the smoke and mirrors of human philosophies and empty words. <br />What can we learn from this illustration?  First, we can see the practical use of worship.  Worship is not the spiritual appeasement of God\'s ego.  It is a weapon for the purpose of defeating the powers of darkness.  God inhabits the praise of His people and thereby binds the powers of darkness (Psalm. 148:6-8).  As in various Biblical accounts, battles are won by beginning with worship.  To his credit, Holyfield used his spirit weapons with obvious success.</p>\n<p>In addition, as was already stated, the natural speaks of the spiritual.  What we have seen here is a foretaste of the kinds of confrontations which are to unfold.  Believer\'s are going to receive a revelation of the \'shekinah\' presence of the Lord.  They will take His presence with them into the arena of life and the Lord Himself will demand a manifestation of demonic powers.  Some will humble themselves in repentance.  Others will respond in pride and rebellion, both hating and persecuting believers.  The victory will not come because of our strength or power.  It will come because we are walking with Him.  For \'In Him we live and move and have our being.\' (Acts 17:28)</p>'),(50,'Entering His Rest','<p />The prospect of entering the rest of God is available to all believers. It is however one of the most perplexing paradoxes in the Christian experience. The reason for this obscurity rests in the fact that only the mature in faith can fully enter the rest of God. Consequently, the rest of God is often misrepresented and\n\nmisunderstood, making it from time to time the subject of more than a little controversy. While an article such as this cannot guarantee one\'s ability to enter, it can provide a perspective from which those desiring to enter may gauge their perceptions, and perhaps some of their experience. My prayer is that it will be a lighthouse for those who have heard the call to enter His rest, and who are at this time labouring to enter.</p>\n<h4>One Grand Mistake</h4>\n<p>The fact that the world around us worships productivity makes the subject of rest a little thorny. The natural man functions from the premise that more effort generally means more productivity, and more time at work means the same -- though someone did say that it is better to work smarter than it is to work harder. One look at the ministry of Jesus could certainly illustrate this point. In just three years of ministry Jesus did more than a normal lifetime of service. Evidently He must have worked smarter! This should easily point out the fact that productivity, or fruitfulness to use a biblical terminology, does not rest on busyness and high volumes of ceaseless activity over long periods of time. Bearing fruit which remains surrounds the issue of means, not energy expended; quality of action, not quantity.</p>\n<p>The principle of \'busyness\' is the catalyst for great deal of \'Christian\' activity today. We like to be \'doing\' because it makes us feel like we have purpose. This activity is not to be confused with fruitfulness however; and since it is our desire to be fruitful, we must look for something more effective than mere busyness. This search may require us to bring our present state of clamour to a halt. Stopping unfortunately is very difficult for most to do, and makes others very nervous. We are often advised to keep moving as it is easier for God to steer a moving vehicle than one which is at a standstill. This is a sound principle of physics, but there is no precedence in scripture. Nowhere is raw activity equated with a state of readiness to do the Lord\'s bidding. Activity is much more often a distraction which satisfies the flesh of man.</p>\n<p>Likening the Christian to a sailboat would do more justice to the Biblical principles we are about to look at. The believers responsibility, when it comes to handling the holy plans of the Lord, is to put up the sail and catch the wind of the spirit, not provide the strength of propulsion. This ensures the activity we are doing for the Lord will actually be generated by the Spirit of the Lord. Most of us prefer self-propulsion since we have neither the faith nor the patience to appreciate God\'s timing. Those who would enter His rest must detach their hearts from the need to be \'busy\', and be prepared to view any function, be it secular or Christian, as a possible barrier to entering His rest.</p>\n<h4>Works of Unbelief</h4>\n<p>Someone who is uncomfortable with the tone of this message may think to quote the passage which says \'faith without works is dead\'. The difficulty with using this as a foundation for activity is that more than a few \'works\' have been motivated by unbelief. We have erroneously come to understand all Christian service as being acts of faith and obedience, when the very opposite can be the case. How then can we determined if our works are being propelled by the faith in the Lord or or by unbelief? The ability to answer this crucial question grows with our faith and experience in the Lord. In fact the capacity to spiritually discern the root of our works belong exclusively to the mature. This article outlines the pattern by which we are groomed for this task.</p>\n<p>When Israel was commanded to enter the promise land they believed the report of the ten spies ignoring the good report of Caleb and Joshua (Num. 13). The next day, realizing they had missed God, they proposed to go up but the Lord was no longer in it. They missed their opportunity and now their resolve to go up was based on guilt and grief rather than faith. The result of their presumptuous actions was disastrous. Dead works are the result, when well intentioned activities, are corralled by something other than a faith.</p>\n<p>A few years ago the Lord called me to serve Him in the ministry. I proclaimed with great confidence that I was stepping out in faith and obedience. After almost a year of toil I sat in a meeting where a prophet from South Africa was sharing that sometimes he did not take offerings because God was his source and not offerings. While this was something I normally would have said myself, I became distinctly aware that the way he said it, and the way I had said it, were not the same. In that moment the Lord revealed my heart and I saw that his works were rooted in a confident obedience, whereas mine were more out of fear. In the secret place of my heart I felt that without speaking engagements and offerings I was doomed. I was therefore very eager to preach. Adding to my mailing list was also vital as I hoped for a percentage of responses each month. My trust was not in the Lord but in the mechanics of ministry. Though the call was unmistaken, the works which surrounded the call were riddled with unbelief and fear.</p>\n<p>This is typical of what many men go through who are genuinely called of God. Having received the call of God we impose a yoke on ourselves which is usually geared to our surroundings and our relative ignorance of the Lord\'s ways. Moses knew in his heart that he was to deliver Israel. His lack of faith caused him to move prematurely, being propelled by human wisdom and strength. It is then that we see him killing the Egyptian. His disillusionment deepened when his own people failed to understand the call on his life. The irony of this situation, which could well be a warning from the the Lord, is that Moses was educated by the most advanced civilization of His day. If human ingenuity could perform the work of God, Moses was ready! Instead, he needed a time of rest in the wilderness where he would receive a heavenly education, while being stripped of his reliance on conventional wisdom. Many receive genuine callings from the Lord but seek to build them by human strength. This path will only burden us with an increasingly heavy yoke which they are unable to bear.</p>\n<p>When the Lord showed me my unbelief it was as if I had been strangling Egyptians all year. I was to stop working to get speaking engagements and wait to be invited. Knowing this was the Lord I determined to obey. Within several months I still had no invitations, but the Lord provided a donor to support the work far better than offerings had been doing. The end result of obedience and faith was that on the surface I was doing less, but receiving more. I had entered a measure of rest through a process of truth, repentance and obedience. Now faith was filling a need which all my strength and ingenuity could not. This was a faith building experience, and since we enter the rest of God through faith, it was a pivotal first transition, establishing a pattern for years to come. The Lord was not interested in how dedicated I could be in making things happen, He only wanted simple steps of obedience.</p>\n<h4>Obedience, Not Sacrifice!</h4>\n<p>Obedience and faith go hand in hand. When Saul grew impatient at Samuel\'s tardiness, he was moved by unbelief to disobey the Word of the Lord. When he supposed to commend himself before Samuel, by pointing to the animal sacrifices, the prophet replied: \'Behold, to obey is better than sacrifice, and to hearken than the fat of rams.\'(1 Samuel 15:22). The Lord was not pleased with a sacrifice He did not request. All too often we act as though the Lord is at a loss for plans and it has somehow fallen to us to fill the gap. In truth the Lord is not short in plan or power, His only lack is men and women who will tremble at His Word. Men and women who will be careful to do what He says: No more. no less!</p>\n<p>It takes a humble man not to presume. Moses first error was in presuming himself fit for delivering the people of God. He mistakenly placed His confidence in the worldly training and wisdom passed to him by the world\'s most advanced civilization. When he emerged from the desert forty years later, he was broken and contrite, ready to listen and obey. Before we can enter the rest of God we must learn to mistrust the powers and abilities of our natural man. We must lose all ambition to speak or do until we are provoked by the Word of the Lord. Though we may be willing to sacrifice much, the only sacrifice He demands is faithful obedience to the Word of His mouth. The same word spoken to Israel in the 95th Psalm, as well as to the Hebrew Christians of the New Testament era (Heb. 3) applies to us now: \'Today if you will hear His voice...\'</p>\n<h4>Unbelief & Toil</h4>\n<p>One of the principles I began to see, was that there was a distinct connection between toil, unbelief and an inability to hear what the Lord is speaking. A lack of faith always causes us to be engaged in more activity. We want to make up for the party who will not come through. In this case that party is the Lord! Rather than resting in what He has said, we are filling the gaps, \'just in case...!\' It was with this in mind that the writer of Hebrews declares: <br />\'Today, if you will hear His voice, do not harden your hearts as in the rebellion, in the day of trial in the wilderness, where your fathers tested Me, tired Me, and saw my works forty years. Therefore I was angry with that generation, and said, \'They always go astray in their heart, and they have not known My ways. So I swore in My wrath, they shall not enter My rest.\'\'  (Hebrews 3:7-11)</p>\n<p>Though God had spoken over and over, the people would approach each new difficulty as if they had never seen the Lord at work. Each time they refused to believe the assurances of the Lord\'s promise to them, they conscripted themselves to additional wanderings. The rest lay not far beyond the scope of their vision but they would not be released to enter until they began to believe Him. Towards the end of the same chapter the writer makes it clear that that unbelief is the chief barrier to entering the Lord\'s rest.</p>\n<p>\'And to whom did He swear that they would not enter His rest, but to those who did not obey? So we see that they could not enter in because of unbelief.\' (Hebrews 3:18-19)</p>\n<p>Unbelief hindered Israel from entering, and today hinders the average Christian. The history of Israel is a metaphor for the Church. They waited to enter a land which flowed with milk and honey; the land of promise. We on the other hand desire to walk in the Lord\'s provision. Our desire is to do the works of God in the power of God. For Israel the physical land of Canaan was their rest , the believer\'s Canaan is a daily experience with God, wherein our surroundings abound with fruitfulness for His eternal Kingdom. <br />Israel could not enter since they feared the obstacles. Though they had seen the Lord conquer the Egyptians they refused to believe He could do it again with the Canaanites. Until they felt skilful enough in the natural, they did not want to engage this enemy. The Christian will lean on his strength when he doubts the power and willingness of God to intervene supernaturally on his behalf. Unbelief resulted in years of wandering in dry places for Israel. For the Christian it means living out a frustrated burdensome existence far from the refreshing ease of God\'s life giving grace.</p>\n<h4>Faith & Rest</h4>\n<p>A certain woman decided to have a potluck dinner for six of her friends. She thought about just inviting them for a regular meal but reasoned that it would be far too much work. She inquired with each one about how much they thought would be necessary to bring and designated specific responsibilities. The day before the dinner she began to wonder if the amount was really enough. She checked with some of her friends, but still did not feel satisfied and decided to make two additional dishes herself. After a while she began to speculate that some may forget to fulfil their responsibilities and prepared two more items. On the evening of the dinner she figured she ought to call everyone to ensure they had not forgotten to attend. In addition to all this preparation she made sure to clean her house from top to bottom, though it was not her ordinary cleaning day. In the end her husband noticed the bountiful leftovers and the amount of needless toil his dear wife had put into the enterprise. But what really surprised him though, was her conclusive statement at the end of the evening. She said, \'Next time we ought to go out to eat, this couldn\'t have been harder if I had done everything myself.\'</p>\n<p>This exaggerated anecdote illustrates the needless toil we often put ourselves through. On top of the anxious fretting, we will often put ourselves through unnecessary hoops, which only steal our capacity to rest. If we were truly objective in our hindsight evaluation, we would recognize much our labor as wasted energy and resources. The extra labor itemized in this somewhat realistic tale is much like the yoke we carry in our efforts to serve the Lord. Taking on additional duties and responsibilities not allotted by the Lord, we run ourselves ragged trying to protect the integrity of God and His work. Far worse is the fact that after all is said and done, we wonder how anything could get done if we did not do it ourselves. Some even become embittered against God when their strength fails. </p>\n<p>The Hebrew\'s writer tells us that there is a promise of rest which we may fail to enter because of unbelief. It also declares that unbelief will cause us to miss the rest, leaving us bound to working in our own strengths and abilities. The root of this condition begins with the hardening of the heart and the refusal to hear His voice (Heb. 3:7). In the midst of our toil the Lord is usually trying to share how unnecessary most of our effort really is. When we come to a point where we can hear the Lord and believe, we are careful to do only what He has said. For this He furnishes us His strength. The Lord in such cases gives us grace only for the things He has actually asked us to do.</p>\n<p>If unbelief causes us to engage in works which will bring no lasting results for the kingdom, faith releases us into works with are great in fruit. Faith, in order to produce, requires only obedience. Unbelief requires vast amounts of human effort, ingenuity and resources. This is where the rest comes. For when we labor in faith and obedience we labor in the strength which God provides; in addition, we remain within the limits He has prescribed. It becomes like sailing! It is not that there is nothing to do, we simply do not labour with the oars as in a row boat. Our responsibility is to have our sail up and ready when the wind blows. The propulsion is furnished by the power of His Word when He speaks to us. When this is our condition, we will discover the following promise fulfilled in our lives and ministries.</p>\n<p>\'Take My yoke upon you and learn from Me, for I am gentle and lowly in heart, and you will find rest for your soul. For My yoke is easy and My burden is light.\' <br />(Matthew 11:29-30)</p>\n<p>If our yoke is not easy and our burden is not light, we may do well to question whether it is indeed Christ\'s yoke, or one of our own making. If we are convinced it is the Lord\'s yoke, it is very likely we have moved prematurely. Working in our strength can be very gratifying in the short-term but tends to cause burnout over the long haul.</p>\n<h4>When God Speaks</h4>\n<p>It is during moments of weakness, when we are wavering under the load of our self-made burden, that the Lord will usually try and speak to us. This is a crucial point since it was Israel\'s refusal to heed the voice of the Lord which condemned them to forty years of additional wanderings, while also ensuring they would not enter the rest. The moment of elevation to rest will always come with the Word of God moving in a fresh way. This brings us to the popular verse in Romans which tells us that \'faith comes by hearing the Word of God\' (Rom.10:17). Higher levels of rest comes from the entrance of the Lord\'s Word. It takes faith to enter the rest, but faith comes from hearing Him when He speaks. Based on this principle it is easy to see why Israel did not enter: They would not hear His voice!</p>\n<p>Incidentally, we are speaking here of the Rhema, or the spoken Word of God. There are two Greek words which translate to \'Word\' in the English language. One refers to the written record(logos), the other the spoken Word(rhema). The way we increase in faith and consequently rest, is by hearing the RHEMA Word of God. This suggests we must be in relationship to the Lord and that His speaking is not general, but specific to our individual situations. We may very well find hundreds of verses to justify our activities in principle, but it is the spoken Word in the context of our relationship which either justifies or judges us.</p>\n<p>Before my South African brother spoke of not needing offerings I was convinced that was walking perfectly in faith. Though His words were not Biblical quotations they became a laser lighted sword illuminating the truest motivations of my heart. As the Psalmist saying \'the entrance of Your Word brings light\'. Even so the spoken Word uncovered what my mind had not known concerning my activities. I was sincere in believing I was doing everything in faith, but I was mistaken. The Rhema of God does indeed produce faith, but it does so by bringing truth to a limited and darkened understanding.</p>\n<h4>Dividing of Soul & Spirit</h4>\n<p>The Rhema of God will divide between what is truly born of the Spirit of God, and what is born of our own souls. The entrance of the Lord\'s light highlights the distinction between what is from below and what is from above. This is essential if we will enter the rest since the basic definition of rest consists of ceasing from our own works.</p>\n<p>\'There remains therefore a rest for the people of God. for he who has entered His rest has himself also ceased from his works as God did from His.\' <br />(Hebrews 4:9-10)</p>\n<p>The one who has truly entered the Lord\'s rest has taken on the Lord\'s yoke and thrown off his own. The Lord\'s yoke is easy because it is undergirded by the grace and power of God. The problem for us is in distinguishing which works are born of the Spirit and which emanate from the secret desires of our own hearts. This is the arena wherein we grow in faith and truth. The Word which produces faith is first the sword of truth revealing unbelief. By unveiling Christ, who is the Word, we are able to see our hearts with a clarity hitherto unknown. Faith comes by hearing the Word; the Word by its very nature is a cutting sword; a consuming fire(Heb. 12:29).</p>\n<p><br />\'For the word of God is living and powerful, and sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing even to the division of soul and spirit, and of joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart.\' <br />(Hebrews 4:12)</p>\n<p>The dilemma for the believer who sincerely desires to serve God is that he cannot know the purity of his works until the Lord speaks. As the Father sent the \'Word of God made flesh\' to reveal the nature of the Father, so the Word today brings a manifestation of Christ to our hearts. All works which are consistent with the substance of Christ are unaffected, while those which are not, become distinctly visible. If we are honest in the evaluation of our works at this time we repent for our sincere, but unbelieving deeds, receiving with meekness the en grafted Word of God.</p>\n<h4>A Two-Fold Purpose</h4>\n<p>There are two significant outcomes in this process. The first purpose of the manifestation of the Lord is to deepen our knowledge of Him. The second purpose is to destroy the works of the evil one(works born of unbelief and the fallen nature). Each of these are intrinsic steps in the maturity of the saints. The final result is an increased awareness of Christ\'s ability to work through us without human effort, and a heightened ability to discern the flesh of man. </p>\n<p>When the disciples asked they might work God\'s works, the Lord never gave them a methodology, he gave them Himself. This is because the intellect of man is ill-equipped to distinguish between good and evil. The immature believer determines a good work to be one of high moral aims; a work designed with sincere purpose to do or be right. The Lord does not judge the appearance of a work but the substance. What life has generated and sustained this enterprise? Someone said, \'the Lord does not appreciate, what He does not initiate\'. The Lord revealed in our hearts becomes the standard by which works are judged. An increasingly clear knowledge of Him is the result of hearing His Word and knowing Him. It is the only way that our taste for what is truly good will mature.</p>\n<p>When we were children we gladly permitted the exhibition of our drawings which we supposed be incredible works of art. Though they may have been fine for children, they certainly could not compete at any real level of ascetic criticism. As we aged and matured our perception of what constituted \'good\' changed dramatically. What we formerly considered good may now be an embarrassment. So it is with the works of God. An immature knowledge of the beauty and perfect holiness of the Lord will lead us to approve as good, anything which we perceive to be remotely redeeming. A mature knowledge of the Lord and His desire will produce a more stringent and pure criteria. The practical result is that we will do less of the frivolous actions based on self. Aware that we cannot do good in ourselves we can do nothing but wait His command. The mature will be fully prepared, and ready with his sail fully hoisted, but he will never man the oars to fulfil a sense of purpose.</p>\n<p>It may be beneficial to point out at this time that there is no skipping the steps to maturity. We cannot read an article such as this and just quit everything in the hopes that somehow an increased ability to distinguish will miraculously appear. As you will see in the next section, there is a process which must be walked out without which we will never increase. The experience of another may give you guidelines for understanding what you may be going through, but it is not possible to substitute their experience for yours. <br />If you cannot distinguish whether the works you are currently involved in, are born of the Lord, then you are best to keep at it. We can do these works knowing that our loving Father will not scold us for being imperfect or young. I do not require my son to change the tires of my car when he is four. I delight in seeing him tinker with my tools off to the side, even when he thinks his assistance is of immeasurable value. As he grows he will naturally begin to distinguish between childish foolishness, and work which is genuinely helpful. When the time is right the Lord will reveal what may be dead works and we will gradually learn to avoid them. Until then we ought to continue or risk uprooting what may be our only training ground. </p>\n<h4>On to Maturity</h4>\n<p>It is the experience we gain which equips us for the next stage of trial and growth. Each time the Lord comes to us with His revealing power, something of His selective taste remains with us. As mentioned earlier, the new believer classifies everything well intentioned as being a pure work for the glory of God. The more we experience the Lord\'s selective but perfect perspective, the more refined our own perceptions become. The goal of this process is that we may be precise in our estimation of \'good\', avoiding all activities touched by the glory and pride of man.</p>\n<p>Before I married my wife I had little taste in clothing. Until my part-time job at a men\'s clothing store, one suit of clothes was as good as the next. After working there a few years I noticed a transition had taken place. Through the experience of seeing hundreds of suits, trying them on, showing them to others, etc. I had naturally developed an ability to distinguish a one hundred dollar suit from a six hundred dollar suit. My appreciation for a \'good\' suit had developed and grown to the point where I did not want to wear some of my old suits. What had previously been very acceptable was now horrid, cheap and completely inadequate. The same thing happens with our perspective of a \'good work for the glory of God\'. Consider the following passage.</p>\n<p>\'For everyone who partakes only of milk is unskilled in the word of righteousness, for he is a babe. But solid food belongs to those who are of full age, that is, those who by reason of use have their senses exercised to discern both good and evil.\' <br />(Hebrews 5:13-14)</p>\n<p>This passage points out that babes are \'unskilled\' in the word of righteousness. The Greek word is apeiros and literally translates inexperienced. Babes then are inexperienced in the word of righteousness, meaning experience in the word becomes the basis for maturity. Of course we are not speaking of the intellectual or academic study of the word, but living encounters with the Word Himself. The word apeiros comes from another word (peira) which means \'a test\' carrying with it the idea of piercing. This suggests the immature are inexperienced in piercing or testing power of the Word. </p>\n<p>The imagery depicted goes something like this: When the Lord desires to test our hearts and the quality of our works flowing from them, He sends the sword of His Word to pierce them. What is made of the same substance as the Word is not pierced or destroyed, whereas what is made with lower grade materials becomes immediately apparent. The purpose is to prune away what is not up to standard. This process is intrinsic to faith and rest, especially when we consider the description of the Word as the sword piercing to the division of soul and spirit from Hebrews 4:12. The mature has had many of these experiences such that his ability to distinguish has become sensitive to what is soul(evil) and what is spirit (good).</p>\n<p>This process requires that we be actively involved in it. The temptation for many is to cease all efforts after hearing a message such as this. However, it is folly quit what we are doing on the basis of someone else\'s revelation of good and evil. For it is those \'who by reason of use have their senses exercized to discern both good and evil\'. We must be willing to do the works we feel inclined to do or else there will be nothing to test. \'And every branch that bears fruit He prunes, that it may bear more fruit.\'(John 15:2). The second feature of the process is loving the Lord\'s Word enough to allow it to enter and evaluate the quality of our works, that we may bear more fruit of better quality. This is where Israel failed. They refused the reproof and correction of the Father, hardening their hearts to His voice. It is also where many of today\'s believers falter.</p>\n<h4>The Chastening</h4>\n<p>The chastening of the Lord is not an easy thing to suffer. Though in the end it produces the fruit of righteousness in our lives it can cause discouragement and real pain. It is for this reason the writer of Hebrews advises us to \'not despise the chastening of the the Lord, nor be discouraged when you are rebuked by Him; for whom the Lord loves He chastens, and scourges every son whom He receives.\' (Heb. 12:5-6) Many refuse the chastening of the Lord thinking it is the enemy trying to bring condemnation on their \'good\' works. It is not easy to pour your emotion and the sum of your strength into something \'for the glory of the Lord\', and then begin to discover that perhaps it was not so such for the Lord as for yourself. <br />The chastening of the Lord is a process of painful discovery. What we assumed to be pure and holy we discover is riddled with selfish intentions. The greater amount of self we eventually find infused in the work, the more pain we experience when it is \'pierced\'. The first disciplinary action we receive from the Lord is often the most painful. First because it never dawned on us that anything that seemed Christian could possibly be in any way wrong. The second reason is that we become unsure of the Lord\'s acceptance. We may feel rejected, not understanding the Lord\'s deep commitment in His discipline. In fact, the very presence of discipline is not a sign of alienation, but of adoption.</p>\n<p>\'If you endure chastening, God deals with you as with sons; for what son is there whom a father does not chasten?\' <br />(Hebrews 12:7)</p>\n<p>The Father who trains his son as a cabinet maker does his son no justice by overlooking poor workmanship. He may temporarily spare the son grief by covering the imperfections, but that would only solidify poor work habits, making the labour of that son of little use. Remember! The Lord has ordained that we bear fruit and that our fruit should remain. His love and commitment to us demands that He purge us of our desire to mix His work with our sin tainted soulish power. The work that brings Him the glory He deserves is accomplished \'not by might , nor by power but by the spirit of the Lord.\' The loving discipline of the Lord is very painful but produces \'righteous fruit\', by teaching us to be strong in the might of His power. <br />\'Now no chastening seems to be joyful for the present, but painful: nevertheless, afterward it yields the peaceable fruit of righteousness to those who have been trained by it.\' <br />(Hebrews 12:11)</p>\n<p>The emphasis of this passage tells us a few things. It tells us that God\'s discipline is not joyful. Notice it is the Lord who takes credit for the discipline which is painful. Next it says that good fruit comes from being trained by the discipline. The Greek word translated trained (gumnazo) is the same word translated \'exercized\' in Hebrews 5:12. Those who have their sense exercized discern what is good, and those who are trained produce good fruit. They are speaking of the very same process.</p>\n<p>When we are evaluated by the Lord we experience the piercing gaze of His fiery presence testing the foundation of our works; our heart. Through this we are pruned and humbled. It can be painful and discouraging but leaves us with a more precise view of what honors the Lord. This in turn equips us for the next round of labour. Many such dealings produce a man or woman who knows the Lord and what truly honors Him. This one will avoid dead works having a keen ability to spot human initiative and strength. He will then be a candidate for works which call for precision accuracy. The most important works are always given to those who have been tested and proven capable.</p>\n<h4>Summary</h4>\n<p>Rather than giving us a method, Jesus pointed to Himself as the focus of our labour. He understood that so long as we are preoccupied with being productive we would be hindered from the real work. The real work of the kingdom begins in our inner man. The Spirit is the spring board for every fruitful deed. The manifestation of Christ sows the seed of his nature into our hearts. As that nature takes root it bears a tree of righteousness which in time produces fruit. The fruit is works performed by the will and power of the Spirit of God. It is the fruit which remains; eternal in essence and flowing with the juice eternal life.</p>\n<p>In John 17:3 Jesus declared \'This is eternal life that they may know you...\' . It is only an increased intimate personal knowledge of Jesus which can equip us to do the works. It is no wonder then that Jesus said, \'This is the work of God, that you believe in Him whom He sent.\' (John 6:29) When we apply our hearts to knowing Him, He comes with His loving discipline. The voice of God issuing the Word of God in a way that consumes the flesh. If we would honor Him we dare not harden our hearts to His voice. For if we do so we will only ensure a lifelong pilgrimage of unnecessary toil and inability to enter His rest.</p>\n<p>\'See that you do not refuse Him who speaks. For if they did not escape who refused Him who spoke on earth, much more shall we not escape if we turn away from Him who speaks from heaven, whose voice then shook the earth; but now He has promised, saying, \'Yet once more I shake not only the earth, but also heaven.\' Now this, \'Yet once more,\' indicates the removal of those things that are being shaken, as of things that are made, that the things which cannot be shaken may remain.</p>\n<p>Therefore, since we are receiving a kingdom which cannot be shaken, let us have grace, by which we may serve God acceptably with reverence and godly fear. For our God is a consuming fire.\'</p>');
