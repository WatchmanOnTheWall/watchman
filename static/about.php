                                    <p>Marc Brisebois is a leader of uncommon vision and authority.  He speaks with
                                        a Prophetic & Apostolic voice to this generation with a strategic wisdom for
                                        building and establishing the Kingdom of God.  Marc is the senior leader of
                                        Spruce Grove Community Church where he is building a company of people into
                                        a cohesive body through foundational teaching & practical ministry.  Several
                                        times a month Marc ministers outside of his local church and has traveled in
                                        ministry to over 40 different countries.</p>
                                    <p>As the founder and director of Watchman on the Wall Ministries, Marc has
                                        successfully self-published a quarterly newsletter called "The Watchman
                                        Chronicle" for the past 23 years.  Relevant and timely prophetic articles
                                        were like a deposit of fresh oil to the believer.  More recently "The
                                        Watchman Chronicle" has evolved into a digital bulletin available on the
                                        Web.  This allows us to also focus on a weekly television program called
                                        "Off The Wall".  This program, broadcast through the Miracle Channel
                                        nationwide in Canada, can literally be seen around the world via satellite,
                                        cable and internet.</p>
                                    <p>Marc has also been involved with the prophetic for many years and in Canada,
                                        functions as a key leader in the National Prophetic Council.  Watchman on
                                        the Wall Ministries is recognized as a credible ministry and in keeping with
                                        its mandate to equip and mobilize believers into continued maturation into
                                        Christ-lineness has been involved in local, national and international
                                        ministry.</p>
                                    <p>Marc has a great support system at home with his wife Wendy and their five
                                        children.  They make their home in Spruce Grove, Alberta.</p>
                                    <p>Watchman on the Wall Ministries began in 1989 and was founded by Marc
                                        Brisebois as an organization committed to teaching and equipping the Body of
                                        Christ.   We believe that the world can be changed only as much as the
                                        church reflects the Glory of Christ.  Therefore, it is imperative that the
                                        Church become a place where the life and presence of Jesus are continuously
                                        manifested.  This begins with the individual believers who are committed to
                                        living in fellowship with the Lord and each other.</p>
                                    <p>Watchman on the Wall Ministries is recognized as a credible ministry and in
                                        keeping with its mandate has been involved in local, national and
                                        international ministry, equipping and mobilizing believers into continued
                                        maturation into Christ-likeness.  Though there is always an evangelistic
                                        dimension whenever truth is preached, our orientation is primarily geared
                                        towards believers.  The release of the Lordâ€™s presence must begin with the
                                        community of believers walking together in love and truth.</p>
