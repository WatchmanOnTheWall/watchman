                                <h1 id="caleb">Watchman on the Wall Ministries</h1>
                                <p>Marc Brisebois is a leader of uncommon vision and authority. He speaks with a Prophetic & Apostolic voice to this generation with a strategic wisdom for building and establishing the Kingdom of God.  Marc is the senior leader of Spruce Grove Community Church where he is building a company of people into a cohesive body through foundational teaching & practical ministry.  Several times a month Marc ministers outside of his local church and has traveled in ministry to over 30 different countries.</p>
                                <p>As the founder and director of Watchman on the Wall Ministries, Marc has successfully self-published a quarterly newsletter called "The Watchman Chronicle" for the past 15 years. Relevant and timely prophetic articles were like a deposit of fresh oil to the believer.  More recently "The Watchman Chronicle" has evolved into a digital bulletin available on the Web.  This allows us to also focus on a weekly television program called "Off The Wall". This program, broadcast through the Miracle Channel nationwide in Canada, can literally be seen around the world via satellite, cable and internet.</p>
                                <p>Marc has also been involved with the prophetic for many years and in Canada, functions as a key leader in the National Prophetic Council.  Watchman on the Wall Ministries is recognized as a credible ministry and in keeping with its mandate to equip and mobilize believers into continued maturation into Christ-lineness has been involved in local, national and international ministry.</p>
                                <p>Marc has a great support system at home with his wife Wendy and their five children. They make their home in Spruce Grove, Alberta.</p>
